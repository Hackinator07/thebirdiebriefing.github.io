                I was raised on a farm in the Great Lakes, nestled beside a tributary of the Root River. My first swings came playing for my high school golf team and I practiced by carrying my clubs on the wagon, hitting shots over our farm&apos;s creek as swallows swooped after my secondhand golf balls. In college, my focus shifted to literature and writing, putting golf aside until a new round brought me back to the game.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                After graduate school, I moved to Seoul, South Korea, where screen golf was everywhere. Golf was more than a game there. Golf was a social fabric, a way to connect with friends and total strangers alike. The passion and joy I found in those indoor rounds, combined with watching Korean professional golfers revived my love for the sport.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                LPGA players are the world&apos;s finest golfers. Athletes whose skill, resilience, and creativity command recognition across sport. Supporting women&apos;s golf to me means more than celebrating victories; it&apos;s about highlighting their stories, elevating their achievements, and confronting the persistent inequalities in golf culture. These remarkable individuals bring diversity and strength to the game, and I&apos;m honored to bring that passion to The Birdie Briefing as I help share their voices.
