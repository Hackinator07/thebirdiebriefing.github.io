The LPGA Tour makes its annual stop in Hawaii this week for the 13th playing of the LOTTE Championship presented by Hoakalei, one of just seven official events left on the 2025 schedule. After the Walmart NW Arkansas Championship was shortened to 18 holes and declared unofficial, this week's event in Ewa Beach has added importance. For players chasing season-long awards or fighting for one of the last few spots in the year's final events, the tournament holds importance.

**The Course**

Hoakalei Country Club will once again provide the stage for the LOTTE Championship. Designed by Ernie Els, the course stretches 6,536 yards for this week's event.

Nine water features shape the routing, with water coming into play on 13 of 18 holes, turning even straightforward shots into a test of precision. 112 bunkers are positioned with purpose, which can make or break a round.

There is also the unpredictability of trade winds. Depending on the breeze, the course can play entirely differently from one day to the next, something the players will be keeping in mind this week at Hoakalei.

**The Players**

Charley Hull returns from a short break after her win in Cincinnati and will make her first start in Hawaii since 2019. Sarah Schmelzel and Nasa Hataoka, who both opened with low numbers in Arkansas, will try to carry that form into Hoakalei. Jennifer Kupcho, winner of the ShopRite LPGA Classic earlier this season, also arrives with momentum after a top-five in Cincinnati and a 65 in her lone round in Arkansas.

Nelly Korda is back, making her first start in Hawaii since her T2 finish in 2021. She enters the week ranked second in scoring average (69.78) behind Jeeno Thitikul, who is notably absent, giving Korda a chance to make up ground in the Player of the Year race.

A Lim Kim returns to defend her 2024 title, where she closed with a 68 to edge Nataliya Guseva by two. It was the second of her three career wins.

**Past Champions in the Field**

Hyo Joo Kim, the 2022 winner, is back and looking for her second title of the season after taking the Ford Championship earlier this year. Brooke Henderson, a two-time LOTTE champion (2018, 2019), is also in the field and fresh off a T15 at the FM Championship.

**Tickets and Details**

The LOTTE Championship begins Wednesday evening, October 1, with coverage each night from 6 to 9 p.m. CT on Golf Channel. The $3 million purse will be split among a 120-player field featuring 21 of the top 50 players in the Rolex Rankings.

Daily tickets start at $34 for general admission and $154 for Champions Club. Weekly passes start at $99 for general admission and $480 for Champions Club. Your Champions Club ticket gets you access to the tournament grounds plus a shared hospitality space overlooking the 18th at Hoakalei Country Club. You'll also get two drink tickets, grab-and-go food, and complimentary general parking.
