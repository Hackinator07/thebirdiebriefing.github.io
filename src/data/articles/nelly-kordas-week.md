If Nelly Korda is going to finally put it all together in 2025, the LOTTE Championship feels like the place. Her ball-striking has been sharp, her scoring average steady at 69.78, and if her putter will cooperate the putter her luck could be about to change.

Part of what makes this week feel different is the field itself. Jeeno Thitikul, Lydia Ko, Minjee Lee, Angel Yin—they’re not here. That leaves the leaderboard a little more breathable, though Charley Hull and Miyu Yamashita remain capable of sneaky low rounds. The key for Korda will be keeping the bogeys under control, posting a low round early, and letting the other players chase her.

The course seems to favor her style: average hole length around 364 yards, visual lines that suit her precision, and enough risk-reward shots to reward patience. For Korda, it feels like the kind of week where four clean rounds could produce a victory.

If she threads it all together and gets the putter passable, the win feels like it could land in her lap. She just needs to move deliberately, stay efficient, and take measured approaches at the right moments.
