The third round of the FM Championship broke open on Saturday under skies that finally stopped threatening rain, and Miranda Wang seized the day. With a bogey-free 65, the 26-year-old Chinese player moved to 18-under, three clear of the field and within reach of her first LPGA win.

What stood out wasn’t just the number (though a seven-birdie round without a blemish is its own statement)--it was the way she carried herself. Wang let birdies come to her. She opened with one at the second, picked off three more on the front, and then let the back nine bloom: 12, 14, and the closer at 18. When her final putt dropped, the gallery gave her an almost riotous cheer.

This stage is a long way from where Wang was a year ago, grinding on partial status and unsure of her next purchase. She made her move this spring on a wildcard at Blue Bay, then surged into rookie contention with a third alongside Lindy Duncan at [Dow](https://www.birdiebriefing.com/news/my-new-favorite-golf-ball/). Now she stands at the front of a tournament that has already seen six rookies win this year, poised to make it seven.

“Today’s performance was definitely a level all players aspire to achieve,” Wang said, smiling as though she knew how rare a day like this can be. “It feels really special to enter the finals as the leader. This is what we strive for every week, so I’m glad I did really well today. I hope I can keep this up.”

The challengers are not lightweights. Rose Zhang, calm as a metronome, posted six birdies against one bogey for a 67, her scorecard clean enough to put her at 15-under and tied for second with Sei Young Kim, who cooled with a 71. Jeeno Thitikul matched Wang’s fireworks with a 65 of her own, Andrea Lee added a 66, and both sit four back. Behind them, Kumkang Park surged with a 64, including an eagle on 4, to join Ayaka Furue (66) and Celine Borge (67) at 13-under.

By late afternoon, the shadows stretched long across the fairways, the crowd thinning into clusters around the 18th green. It had the quiet edge of a Saturday. Everyone sensed that Sunday could swing wild. Wang has the form, the lead, and the confidence. Unpredictable as it’s been, Boston has saved its best for last. Sunday promises to be spectacular.

## Round 3 Competition Highlights
