Miranda Wang's second round at the FM Championship stretched into an endurance test—ten hours, three rain delays, and one final putt just to close the book. When play stopped, she sat at 11-under, the leader on paper, though the scoreboard still carried the weight of Sei Young Kim's DNF.

Kim showed up this morning like someone who'd been ready all night. Like she played screen golf with her friends and had some Chamisul for good measure. Eagle at the 2nd, birdie-birdie on 3 and 4, and just like that she took the lead away with another 65. It felt like the only way this fractured, stop-and-start round could end—jagged, a little surreal. I'm left drifting, wondering what on earth happened to Nelly Korda?

Even now, I'm trying to make sense of what we saw on TPC Boston's 4th hole. A 298-yard par 4, wind swirling, where the hope and hubris of below-average golfers like me go to die. I'm going to go Midwestern here, but for Pete's sake, Corpuz, A Lim Kim, and Thompson all walked off with double bogeys there?!

The day belonged to the weather—of course it did. I should know better by now, after so many nights in the Boundary Waters, listening to wind howl and rain drum against a tarp while swaying in a hammock. You respect the weather, or it will cut you down. And on this day, the weather owned as much of the story as the golf itself. Players went out beneath heavy gray skies, only to be chased back by rolling thunderstorms. By the time the last horn blew at 7:15 p.m., the round was swallowed by darkness, with 72 players still on the course.

At 7 a.m. they picked up where they left off, closing out the second round before rolling into the third at 12:30. Which leaves us asking: what went down?

Jeeno Thitikul, the world's No. 1, also endured the stop-start pace. She sprinted down the ninth fairway with Green and defending champion Lauren Coughlin as dark clouds rolled in, hoping to beat the next horn. The Thai star finished with a 68, highlighted by four birdies on the back nine. Coughlin walked off with a 73, having double bogeyed the 17th.

We've mentioned her before, but Hannah Green—trying to shake off four straight missed cuts—finally found some rhythm as the thunder rolled. She rattled off five birdies to card a second-round 68, vaulting herself into contention at eight under.

Meanwhile, Sweden's Madelene Sagstrom—maybe right at home in wind and driving rain—stayed in the hunt with a steady putting stroke, six birdies, and a flawless 66. A strong bounce-back after the double bogey on the 2nd hole yesterday.

Finally, Rose Zhang showed the kind of calm, mature play you wouldn't expect from someone just 22. She racked up eight birdies, avoided a single bogey, and positioned herself in solo third at ten under. If she can keep that composure, the rest of the weekend could see her pressing Sei Young and contending for the win.

With the forecast calling for clearer skies, both tournament officials and players are optimistic about getting the schedule back on track for Saturday and Sunday. The main adjustment: after the cut, players will tee off in threesomes for Round 3.

*At the time of this article posting, the cut has been set and Round 3 is underway.*
