The LPGA Tour's Asian Swing continues this week with the 2025 Maybank Championship at Kuala Lumpur Golf & Country Club, where 78 players will compete for a $3 million purse and valuable points toward the Rolex Player of the Year, Vare Trophy, and Race to the CME Globe standings. Returning to its late-October date, the no-cut event brings one of the strongest fields of the fall, featuring 29 of the world's top 50 players. With only four tournaments remaining in the 2025 season, players are looking to build momentum before the Tour moves on to Japan and the season-ending events in Florida.

**The Venue**

The West Course at Kuala Lumpur Golf & Country Club plays as a par 72 at 6,536 yards. Originally designed by Nelson & Haworth and renovated by Parslow & Winter in 2008, the course has previously hosted PGA and DP World Tour events.

The layout rewards precision, with approach play and scrambling often separating contenders from the rest of the field. Ruoning Yin and Celine Boutier both ranked first in scrambling during their winning weeks. The short par-4 16th hole (332 yards), this week's Aon Risk Reward Challenge hole, presents a critical late-round scoring opportunity.

**Local Player Highlights**

Malaysia will be represented by Mirabel Ting and Ashley Lau among 3 others. Ting, 20, was the low amateur in last year's championship, finishing T12 before turning professional in July after earning the Annika Award as college golf's top player. Lau, Malaysia's top-ranked professional, finished T22 here in 2024 and competed in the 2024 Paris Olympics.

**Conditions**

Hot and humid weather is expected throughout the week, with highs in the mid-90s°F (36°C) and the potential for afternoon thunderstorms. Firm conditions could favor precise ball-strikers and players with reliable distance control.
