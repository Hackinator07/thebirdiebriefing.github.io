Thursday at TPC River's Bend was shared by two players, but we'll address the baller first.

Gigi Stoll delivered the best round of her LPGA career to end the day two off Chanette Wannasaen with a 7-under 65.

The Oregon native has had a season of mixed results up to this point. She's made six cuts in sixteen starts before this week, but she certainly had a first-round breakthrough to shake the concerns.

"I've kind of had a little bit of a struggle golf-wise, but my personal life has been really good," Stoll said after the round. "The dots are finally connecting, and I've been putting myself in position to play good. Today, I did that."

Though Stoll parred her first four, she then went birdie-birdie at the par-3 fifth and par-5 sixth, then added another at the eighth. After another birdie at 10, she landed arguably the overall highlight of her and THE day -- an eagle at the par-5 11th -- and even just watching digital leaderboards, a fan could feel the momentum shift.

She briefly gave one back at 17, but in proper fashion, she piped a drive on 18 and closed with a birdie. Yup. $

Thailand's Chanettee Wannasaen grabbed the early lead with a 9-under 63, tying the 18-hole tournament scoring record. She went bogey-free, carding one eagle and seven birdies.

Around them, Nelly Korda performed well. A dialed iron game helped her finish with a 67 despite 3 bogeys.

Not everyone had it working -- Fiona Xu struggled mightily, finishing +17 before withdrawing from the event.

But day one in Queen City still felt like it belonged to Stoll. She played with confidence, and from the scores it was clear she knew she could stay on the leaderboard.

Here's to Round 2 of what we might have to start calling the *Yasss Queen City Championship.*

## Round 1 Competition Highlights

**Chanettee Wannasaen** shot a bogey-free 63 with an eagle on 10 and seven birdies. She tied the tournament scoring record at TPC River's Bend adn matched Ko from last year.

**Gigi Stoll** shot a career low 7-under 65. She posted six birdies and an eagle on the 479 yard, par 5 11th.

**Six players â€” Peiyun Chien, Jenny Bae, Paphangkorn Tavatanakit, Sei Young Kim, A Lim Kim, and Kum Kang Park** all opened with 66s in round 1.

**Paphangkorn Tavatanakit and Jenny Bae** both closed birdie-eagle, and Park rattled off three straight birdies to end her round.

## Shout Out

**Gigi $toll.** Full stop.

**Maria Fassi** for having two eagles on the trot (8 and 18)!

## Gear Notes

Lyida Ko is gaming a [Scotty Cameron GSS Proto flatstick](https://www.scottycameron.com/authentication/registry/Details.aspx?rn=A035684) and made the switch from brown to black. Here's hoping a smooth stroke comes with the clean look!
