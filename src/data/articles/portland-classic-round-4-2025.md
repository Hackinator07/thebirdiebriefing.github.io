Akie Iwai's first win had been circling all season, tapping her shoulder in Thailand, wagging its finger in Los Angeles. Then she watched her twin sister, Chisato, sip champagne in Mexico while she smiled through the twinge of being the other half of the story. On Sunday in Portland, she finally got to write her own ending.

The 23-year-old rookie from Saitama closed with a bogey-free 66 to win The Standard Portland Classic by four, finishing at 24-under. Six birdies and no errors -- the kind of round players dream about but rarely manage when it matters most. She birdied Nos. 5 and 6 to settle herself, then went about the back nine like a painter, deliberate and precise in her strokes. She sealed the victory with birdies on 17 and 18, the last an 18-footer that rolled in with the composure of a player who had already made up her mind about the outcome.

That's when sister Chisato came running across the green, champagne bottle in hand. If the LPGA is still searching for its next great sibling storyline, it found it in that moment -- a younger sister by sixty seconds dousing her twin in fizzy, French affirmation.

The rest of the field deserves their ink. American Gurleen Kaur posted her career-best finish, runner-up at 20-under, and appeared like a player eager to keep going if only there had been a fifth round to play. Linn Grant shared third with Chisato, and Grace Kim stayed in the conversation at 18-under. Even Oregon amateur Kiara Romero made noise with a 64 and a tie for seventh, giving the local Ducks faithful a glimpse of the future. But in truth, the week belonged to Akie.

Her win folds neatly into a larger Japanese surge on tour this year. She became the fifth from her country to win in 2025, joining Chisato, Rio Takeda, Mao Saigo, and British Open champion Miyu Yamashita. It feels less like coincidence and more like a movement, each name sharpening the edge of Japanese golf. And by winning, Akie and Chisato joined a rare sorority -- sisters etched into LPGA history alongside the Kordas, the Jutanugarns, and the Sorenstams.

What will linger from this Sunday, though, isn't the data. It's the image of Akie exhaling on the 72nd green, her mother in tears nearby, the pressure of all those close calls finally lifting.

And so, among the verdure of Portland's towering trees and fairways, Akie Iwai hoisted her first LPGA trophy, champagne-soaked and smiling. She departed Columbia Edgewater not as the twin chasing but standing in the place she had long been chasing.

## Final Round Competition Highlights

**Grace Kim** two back entering the day, led the field in putting despite a couple of three-putts this week; she rolled 3 key birdies on the back nine to finish in 5th with an 18 under 270

**Gurleen Kaur** bounced back from a slow start yesterday, birdieing the 7th, 9th, 10th, and 17th holes, with accurate wedge shots, bringing her within a shot of the lead several times.

**Chisato Iwai** already an LPGA winner; eagled multiple par fives to finish the day at a 64

**Linn Grant** delivered an impressive weekend with rounds of 66-71-65-67. Could she be next to capture a tournament victory? We certainly hope so.

**Aditi Ashok** finished strong, carding three late birdies to reach 17-under, highlighting a standout performance.

**Akie Iwai** sank crucial putts down the stretch, including a long one on the 18th, to secure her win of The Standard Portland Classic and join her sister Chisato as an LPGA champion.

## Shout Out

**Gurleen Kaur** comes in solo second. Exactly the kind of golf we want to see more of!

## Gear Notes

**Akie Iwai** captured The Standard Portland Classic [gaming the Z-STAR XV](https://us.dunlopsports.com/srixon/steady-dominance-products/z-star-xv-golf-balls/10360119.html), putting the ball back in the winner's circle. Srixon's has had a dominant 2025 season, collecting three majors at the Chevron Championship, Amundi Evian, and AIG Women's Open.
