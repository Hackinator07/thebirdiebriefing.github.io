Round One at the Maybank Championship set an early tone of sharp ball-striking and course management across the field. With soft greens and receptive conditions at Kuala Lumpur Golf & Country Club, players took advantage, producing a day filled with tight approaches and confident putting.

**Lydia Ko** opened her week with steady play, relying on patience and touch around the greens. After gripping down to avoid a heavy shot on the par-4 second, she produced one of the cleaner recoveries of the morning and later handled a tough bunker test without issue.

**Ashleigh Buhai** nearly stole the spotlight early, knocking her approach at the seventh to inches in a near-perfect read of both distance and slope.

Fresh off a team victory last week, **Grace Kim** carried that momentum, rolling in five birdies to post a solid opening round and stay comfortably in the mix at T32.

The local crowd had reason to cheer with **Mirabel Ting**, who matched poise with precision on home soil. Her sharp iron play at the seventh and another fine look on 14 helped her post a five-under 67, putting her tied for eleventh.

Both **Angel Yin** and **Ronni Yin** made mid-round charges. Angel found her rhythm on the back nine with four birdies, while Ronni delivered the kind of controlled iron play that recalled her standout form from 2024.

But the day ultimately belonged to **Hye Jin Choi**, who capped a standout round with a long birdie putt on 18 to shoot 64, highlighted by an eagle at the par-5 third. Choi heads into Friday holding the solo lead, with Gemma Dryburgh, Benedetta Moresco, Patty Tavatanakit, Hannah Green, and Lydia Ko all within striking distance.

The leaderboard is tight, the pace is sharp, and Kuala Lumpur looks set for a compelling Round Two.

## Shout Out

**Chisato Iwai** getting an eagle on the Aon Risk Reward 332 yard par 4 16th which is also considered the hardest hole on the course.

**Wei Ling Hsu**, a member of the World Team at the Hanwha LIFEPLUS International Crown, continued her strong form with a 5-under 67 today. Marie and I have really enjoyed watching her—her lively, genuine energy on the course is such a refreshing contrast to the more media trained players.
