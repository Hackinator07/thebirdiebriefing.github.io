The 51st CPKC Women's Open doesn't just look like a major, it feels like it. The field would pass for one in any corner of the golf world. 156 players are here, six of them sitting in the Rolex top 10, and every one chasing a slice of $2.75 million and the chance to carve their name on the open trophy.

**The Venue**

This year's Canadian Open takes place on the fairways of Mississaugua Golf & Country Club, a course that carries real gravitas. The Credit River winds through its valley, shaping a landscape at once pastoral and formidable. The greens and bunkers, refined by Donald Ross, still bear the original mark of George Cumming's design. And as the spotlight shines, Canada is poised to put its finest golf and hospitality on display for us. 

It is important to recognize that this course stands on the traditional lands of the [Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation](https://mncfn.ca/), whose history and connection to this traditional territory carries significance greater than the game played upon it.

**The Past in Play**

For some in the field, Mississaugua is not entirely new ground. In 2016, the club hosted the World Junior Girls Championship, where Yuka Saso hoisted the individual trophy while leading the Philippines to a team win. She's back now as a two-time U.S. Women's Open champion, looking to rediscover the magic of those fairways. Alongside her are Haeran Ryu, Maja Stark, and Esther Henseleit -- players who also walked these grounds in that juniors championship and now return as proven winners.

**Maple Leaf Standouts**

Brooke Henderson, the face of Canadian golf and a 13-time LPGA Tour winner, is in the field and hot off a T23 finish in Portland. Henderson's 2018 triumph at this championship remains one of the defining moments in Canadian sport, ending a 45-year drought and being the first national win since Jocelyne Bourassa in 1973. She leads a group of Canadians in the field, each chasing that same dream of lifting their country's championship trophy on home soil (maybe sneaking in a few celebratory Tim Hortons Timbiebs for good measure).

**The World's Best Are Back**

[Newly crowned No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul](https://www.birdiebriefing.com/news/jeeno-thitikul-quiet-stride/) makes her first start since climbing past Nelly Korda in the rankings. Korda, meanwhile, is still searching for her first win of 2025 despite a season full of close calls. Lydia Ko, a three-time winner of the Canadian Open, returns with the kind of experience that makes her dangerous. And rising star Lottie Woad, riding wins in Ireland and Scotland, adds another layer of intrigue to an already loaded entry list.

**Coughlin Returns**

[At Earl Grey Golf Club](https://earlgreygolfclub.com/) in Calgary last year, Lauren Coughlin finally cracked through with her first LPGA victory at this very event. That win ignited a streak that carried her to a second title at Dundonald and a victorious debut in the Solheim Cup. Now, back in Canada to defend, she brings momentum with her, a T7 finish last week in Portland.

**Sponsor Invitees**

The championship has also welcomed sponsor invites that ensure the next wave has its chance to shine. Ontario's Alena Sharp and Quebec's Maude-Aimée Leblanc are in the field, joined by rising amateurs like Anna Davis, Carla Bernat Escuder, and U.S. Women's Amateur champion Megha Ganne.

**Sustainable Approach**

Golf Canada is raising the bar on sustainability at the Open, aiming to make the tournament zero-waste and carbon-neutral. Partnering with the Green Event Ninjas, the event has already diverted 75% of waste, recycled thousands of kilograms of material, and eliminated nearly 68,000 single-use water bottles. With fans encouraged to bike, carpool, and engage in eco-friendly practices, the Open is setting a new standard for environmental responsibility.

**Be Part of It**

The CPKC Women's Open is a full-on festival for fans of all ages, and this year there are plenty of ways to make your tournament experience unforgettable. [General admission tickets](https://www.cpkcwomensopen.com/tickets/) start at $21 for Wednesday, $52 Thursday through Saturday, and $63 for Sunday. A full-week pass is available for $147. Juniors 12 and under get free grounds access when accompanied by an adult, and those 13–17 enjoy a 15% discount on specific single-day grounds tickets, making it easy to bring the next generation of fans to the action.

For those looking to elevate the experience, the **Heritage Lounge** offers an exclusive viewing deck between the 11th and 12th holes, complete with covered seating, upgraded food and beverage, reserved washrooms, and closed-circuit televisions.

Fans can also upgrade their tickets for $30 per day to access the themed 10th hole, The Rink. Yes, we're talking puckboards. Somebody better roll in with an [Odyssey Hockey Stick Putter](https://odyssey.callawaygolf.com/putters/putters-2025-happy-gilmore.html) while wearing a hockey jersey. What's more, your upgrade is a donation to support MacKids, and every dollar will be matched by CPKC.

The CPKC fan experiences beyond The Rink include the First Tee Long Putt Challenge, golf-inspired carnival games, Autograph Alley presented by Golf Town, and two Brooke Brigade viewing zones that give juniors front-row access to the 1st and 15th greens. Participants also get t-shirts, snacks, and drinks, making it a full-on fan experience for all.

So whether you're chasing the thrill of the leaderboard, enjoying the festival atmosphere, or simply looking for a unique day out with family and friends, the CPKC Women's Open delivers a chance to see the world's best up close while creating memories that last.

And remember -- keep your stick on the ice.

*On a personal note, Marie and I feel a connection here -- Mississaugua saw revisions in 1919 by Donald Ross, the same mind behind [Kenosha Country Club](https://www.kenoshacountryclub.com/). Anyone who's played the restored Kenosha or another Ross course knows how effortlessly his designs merge with the natural terrain.*
