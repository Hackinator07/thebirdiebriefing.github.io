If the 2025 LPGA season needed one more storyline to cap its unpredictable run, Youmin Hwang delivered it. The 22-year-old from South Korea, competing on a sponsor exemption, closed with a 5-under 67 at Hoakalei Country Club to finish 17-under and win the Lotte Championship by one shot over Hyo Joo Kim.

Hwang began the day four shots behind but closed with five birdies in her final six holes, including the last four, to claim her first LPGA title. The KLPGA member becomes the 26th different winner in 25 LPGA events this season, tying the record for most unique champions in a single year.

Each of the top players on the leaderboard went into Saturday's round with an entirely different attitude. Minami Katsu, who had been able to press during the Arkansas Championship, wanted to take the step from contender to winner. She birdied the first hole, saved par from a bunker on the second, and chipped in on the sixth to reach 15-under. Hyo Joo Kim was putting the ball better than anyone with birdies on holes five, six, and seven, taking a share of the lead by the turn. Kim then extended her advantage with a long birdie putt from off the green on the par-4 15th, moving to 16-under and maintaining control as the wind picked up late in the round.

World No. 2 Nelly Korda made an early back-nine push with a near hole-out on the 10th and a birdie on 11 to reach 15-under, but missed birdie chances on 13 and 17, and a bogey on 16 left her tied for fourth at 14-under after a final-round 69. It marked her sixth top-five finish of the season but continued her winless streak in 2025.

As the leaders made the turn, Hwang was quietly building momentum. After birdies on 13 and 15, she pulled within one of Kim. When Kim and Katsu both bogeyed the par-3 17th, Hwang's birdie on the par-5 18th from the group ahead moved her to 17-under, giving her the outright lead. Kim needed an eagle on 18 to force a playoff but settled for a birdie, finishing one back at 16-under after a 68. Katsu closed with 69 to finish third at 15-under.

Hwang's win came after rounds of 67-62-75-67. Her 62 on Thursday tied the tournament's 18-hole scoring record and set up the opportunity she capitalized on over the weekend. It was her third start at the Lotte Championship and sixth overall on the LPGA Tour.

"I focused on my play, one shot at a time," Hwang said through a translator. "It's an honor to play with the strong players on the LPGA Tour and to win in a tournament sponsored by Lotte."

The victory earned Hwang $450,000 and the option to take immediate LPGA membership or defer it until 2026. She chose to defer.

Kim, who won the Lotte in 2022, finished runner-up for the second time this season. Katsu's third-place finish was her best result of the year. Behind them, Korda, Iwai, Peiyun, and Provasnik tied for fourth.

The LPGA Tour now moves to Asia for the five-event fall swing, beginning with the Buick LPGA Shanghai at Qizhong Garden Golf Club starting October 9th.

## Shout Out

**The coverage of Round 4 from the Golf Channel** deserves high praise. The simultaneous birdie putt feeds in picture-in-picture, the behind-the-ball putt cameras, and the rapid, seamless tracking of all the leaders felt fresh, special, and truly impressive. This is the kind of coverage we want to see more of. It was engaging and well executed.

## Gear Notes

Nothing of major note from round 4.
