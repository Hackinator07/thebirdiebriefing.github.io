The first round of the CPKC Women's Open gave us a leaderboard that was equal parts expected and surprising. Familiar champions like Jin Young Ko and Nelly Korda went searching for form, Akie Iwai posted a flawless 64 to take the solo lead, and a 15-year-old Canadian amateur with an unshakable stare stole much of the spotlight.

Jin Young Ko--once unstoppable, now two years removed from her last win looked steady, carding 5 birdies, including the par 5s of 12 and 13. Showing the pinpoint iron play that earned her the world No. 1 spot in 2020, this is the same player who went bogey-free over 72 holes to claim this event in 2019--and sheâ€™s signaling she could do it again.

Nelly Korda, meanwhile, is still chasing her first victory of 2025 after piling up seven a year ago. Her round was a blend of sharp birdies and a rare stumble at the 175-yard par-3 third. Still, she exhibited the brilliance that makes her game so unmistakable--none better than a wedge from 81 yards that back-spun into easy scoring range. The mudball she faced at 11, the toughest hole of the day, was the kind of bad break that can throw off rhythm, but she salvaged enough to save par.

And then there's sponsor invitee Aphrodite Deng, the Canadian amateur who plays like she's seen this stage before. Just 15 years old and already a U.S. Girls' Junior champion, she led stretches of the day with poise beyond her years. She hit nearly every fairway, stuck approaches close, and even when she missed, her recovery shots carried quiet confidence. Whether it's adrenaline or just youth, Deng hasn't blinked. Six birdies and a first-round 66 have her sitting T2, making her Canadian debut a national storyline.

Megan Kang, 2023's CPKC winner in Vancouver, kept herself firmly in the mix with three birdies in four holes. Kang knows this golf course, knows the pressure, and still makes it look routine. Her controlled fades off the tee and steady putting kept her close to the leader.

Other names surfaced and impressed: Gaby Lopez, showing graceful touch, finished her round tied for second with 7 birdies; rookie Ina Yoon grinding out pars from thick Canadian rough; and Taiwan's Chien Peiyun carded a 68 thanks to her crisp ball striking.

The greens rolled pure--"smooth," one player said--rewarding aggressive iron play but punishing hesitation. Several players noted switching to firmer wedges this week to handle the tight and muddy fringes. Together, the field and Mississaugua produced exactly the kind of test you'd expect from an LPGA stage of this caliber.

## Round 1 Competition Highlights

**Jin Young Ko's** birdie run included a sharp seven-iron at 16 to set up her fourth birdie of the day, showing flashes of her 2019 Ontario form.

**Gaby Lopez** recorded six birdies in her final 10 holes, tying for the most birdies in the field on Thursday with seven.

**Nelly Korda** recovered from a shaky approach on 11 with a perfectly flighted 81-yard wedge at 12 that spun to four feet, keeping her in contention.

**Jeeno Thitikul** also at T2, shot six birdies over her last 10 holes, including back-to-back birdies on Nos. 3-4 and 9-10. It was her first start at the CPKC Women's Open since moving to Rolex No. 1.

**Aphrodite Deng**, the 15-year-old amateur, hit nearly every fairway and dropped just one bogey, holding her ground against seasoned winners and ended R1 as the lowest Canadian in the field.

**Megan Kang**, last year's champion, climbed the board with a burst of birdies on the back nine, demonstrating comfort and poise at Mississaugua.

**Soo Bin Joo** sits 7th at four under, citing improvements in mental game, swing, putting, and chipping for her solid round.

**Leona Maguire** sits T2 after a 66, posting six birdies against one bogey. She missed just one fairway, birdied it, and praised the smooth greens for giving herself plenty of scoring opportunities.

**Yuna Nishimura** electrified the gallery with a long birdie putt that rolled true, a reminder of her fearless putting stroke.

**Hae Ran Ryu** displayed precise iron play with aggressive wedge shots into tucked pins, earning multiple birdies.

**Lindy Duncan** clanged her approach off the flagstick at 16, striking the cup so sharply it dented the metal.

## Shout Out

Puppy pets to Blue, the German Shepherd-Malinois mix from the [Halton Regional Police Service](https://www.haltonpolice.ca/en/index.aspx), for holding down duties as the official course dog.

Hats off to the [local cormorant](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Double-crested_Cormorant/overview) feasting on Credit River catfish. Thanks for sharing a little slice of wild beauty while we watched the action.

## Gear Notes

Nothing too major to note. A few players opted for stiffer-shafted wedges to better handle the thick, muddy fringes and rough around the course.
