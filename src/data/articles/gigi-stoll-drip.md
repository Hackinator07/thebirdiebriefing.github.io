Gigi,

Marie and I have been following your game both on and off the course [(thanks to your Insta)](https://www.instagram.com/gigistoll_/), and we just have to say -- you crush it. The swagger, baseball Oakleys, long socks, and street-style threads made for golf -- your whole package just works. You’re showing that golf doesn’t have to be stiff, that it doesn’t have to wear pastel polos. You make it look easy.

And then there’s your music. [GG AKA Golf God](https://youtu.be/8v4wqc8X3hQ?si=upVZ6uXtvCR9sdzm). You’re writing lyrics and recording tracks like “Attention,” “Jealous,” and “Summer Love” while living as a touring pro. You do it without anyone needing to validate it. Few athletes -- or people, really -- could pull that off with this much truth.

We also read about how cutting your hair at the University of Arizona symbolizes personal freedom, and you’ve carried that truth forward ever since. You’ve turned your platform into one of encouragement, showing that life is too short to hide or conform. A life of truth that runs parallel to your golf journey. You show us that excellence doesn’t demand giving up what makes us unique. That it is possible to be multidimensional and brilliant all at once. 

And Gigi, what a joy to read you popped the question to your partner in the mountains of Switzerland. That is a beautiful, rare thing, and it deserves to be celebrated fully. Let it be a bright moment that adds even more light to your already vibrant life.

Keep swinging with style, speaking with honesty, and living with that fearless, unapologetic energy. We’ll be cheering from the gallery, excited to see where your next shot, song, or adventure takes you.

- Marie and George
