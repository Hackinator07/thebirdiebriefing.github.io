I was raised on a farm in the Great Lakes, nestled beside a tributary of the Root River. My first swings came playing for my high school golf team and I practiced by carrying my clubs on the wagon, hitting shots over our farm's creek as swallows swooped after my secondhand golf balls. In college, my focus shifted to literature and writing, putting golf aside until a new round brought me back to the game.

After graduate school, I moved to Seoul, South Korea, where screen golf was everywhere. Golf was more than a game there. Golf was a social fabric, a way to connect with friends and total strangers alike. The passion and joy I found in those indoor rounds, combined with watching Korean professional golfers revived my love for the sport.

As I see it, LPGA players are the world's finest golfers. Athletes whose skill, resilience, and creativity command recognition across sport. Supporting women's golf to me means more than celebrating victories; it's about highlighting their stories, elevating their achievements, and confronting the persistent inequalities in golf culture. These remarkable individuals bring diversity and strength to the game, and I'm honored to bring that passion to The Birdie Briefing as I help share their voices.
