At The Birdie Briefing, we amplify the stories, achievements, and voices of women in golf--because the sport deserves more than a side note. We believe women’s golf should be covered, respected, and celebrated with the same depth and passion as men’s golf, and we’re here to make that happen.

Our coverage spans LPGA tournaments, player profiles, and industry insights, always looking past the scorecard to spotlight the challenges, triumphs, and personal journeys that shape the game.

Whether you’re a lifelong golfer, a casual fan, or just discovering the sport, The Birdie Briefing is your gateway to a version of golf that’s vibrant, inclusive, and told through a lens that’s uniquely ours.
