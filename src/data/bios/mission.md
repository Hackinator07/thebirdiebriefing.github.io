At The Birdie Briefing, we spotlight the stories, achievements, and voices of women in golf—because this game deserves more than a footnote. Women's golf deserves the same depth and passion as men's, and that's what we deliver.

From LPGA tournament coverage to player profiles and inside stories, we go beyond scorecards to share the challenges, triumphs, and journeys that shape the game.

Whether you're a lifelong golfer, a new fan, or just curious, The Birdie Briefing is your gateway to women's golf—vibrant, inclusive, and told in our own voice.
