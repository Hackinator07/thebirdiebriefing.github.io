class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">There was a silence on the 18th green at TPC River&#x27;s Bend late Sunday. This wasn&#x27;t the kind of Sunday for ice cream at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMlTbKKN7h2/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1" node="[object Object]" class="text-primary-600 hover:text-primary-700 transition-colors duration-200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charley&#x27;s Mini Golf</a>. Spectators weren&#x27;t whispering; they were holding their breath. Charley Hull found herself with a short putt to win her third LPGA event, yet the story wasn&#x27;t just about her ball. It was also about one that had just rolled and rolled far too many times off the putter of the world&#x27;s best player. <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/t3uoJslHLS4?si=mcb089QgETyd1Vjx" node="[object Object]" class="text-primary-600 hover:text-primary-700 transition-colors duration-200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeeno Thitikul had just four-putted</a> from a range that should&#x27;ve been routine, her last stroke a decelerated push. It was a tragedy that makes even casual fans wince and think to themselves, &quot;She&#x27;s one of us.&quot;</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">The crowd looked ill, and Hull incredulous.</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">She stepped away from her own putt twice, plumb bobbed her <a href="https://www.taylormadegolf.com/TP-Hydro-Blast-Soto-/DW-TA327.html?lang=en_US" node="[object Object]" class="text-primary-600 hover:text-primary-700 transition-colors duration-200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TP Hydro Blast</a> like she was lining up a bet she couldn&#x27;t afford to lose, then rolled it. Dead center. Pin still in as always. And with that, she won her first event of 2025.</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">&quot;I didn&#x27;t really process it,&quot; Hull said afterward. &quot;Jeeno played great today. She was very solid. Unfortunate what happened to her on the last hole. At the end of the day, I just felt like I needed a little bit of luck on my side in the last few years because I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s ever gone my way and it&#x27;s finally got my way for once. Every dog has its day.&quot;</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">It had been 1,077 days since Hull&#x27;s last LPGA win, at the Volunteers of America Classic in 2022. She made sure to end the drought in style—posting rounds of 68-65-67-68 to finish 20-under 268 and collect $300,000.</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">In reality, the final round was a duel long before they walked up to 18. Hull started with the lead but slipped a shot behind on 14 when Thitikul rolled in a birdie. <a href="https://youtu.be/M1SAih6OXUQ?t=244" node="[object Object]" class="text-primary-600 hover:text-primary-700 transition-colors duration-200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">She answered on 16, sinking a long birdie putt</a> after splashing it in the bunker off the tee. She then gave it right back with a bogey at 17. Thitikul&#x27;s steady par there sent her to the last with a one-shot cushion. Hull admitted she thought she had to eagle the 18th just to have a chance.</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">&quot;On 18, pushed my driver a little bit. Hit a nice cut 9-iron round the tree. Didn&#x27;t quite cut. Thought I had to hole the putt and just two-putted,&quot; Hull said. &quot;I don&#x27;t really remember much from the last hole. It was a little bit of a shock. I was nervous over that putt. My hands were shaking. I think I was more shocked, and the adrenaline and everything.&quot;</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">I called Hull the <a href="https://www.birdiebriefing.com/news/charley-hull-queen-almost/" node="[object Object]" class="text-primary-600 hover:text-primary-700 transition-colors duration-200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;Queen of the Almost&quot;</a> earlier this summer, after she&#x27;d managed to collect her runner-up at the AIG Women&#x27;s Open at Porthcawl. Her road to this moment hasn&#x27;t been smooth. She battled injuries all season—torn ankle ligaments, a back injury from lifting a box, and even a virus that caused her to withdraw from Evian after she fainted. When asked if she plays better hurt, Hull didn&#x27;t hesitate: &quot;It slows my mind down. I always find when I&#x27;m poorly, ill, I usually play good golf. My mind is 100 miles an hour, but when I&#x27;m poorly, I find I&#x27;m more relaxed, and I probably expect less and do less. My days are usually full out, going to the gym, golf, practice. When I&#x27;m kind of poorly or injured I do a lot less and I put less pressure on myself. Then I kind of do better sometimes.&quot;</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">This is all on brand for Charley Hull: she doesn&#x27;t just play; she insists on being part of the story. She&#x27;s aggressive off the tee, unafraid to fire at pins, and when she&#x27;s on, you&#x27;re captivated.</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">Was this win gift-wrapped by Thitikul&#x27;s collapse? Absolutely. But Hull had to be there to capitalize on it.</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">Queen of the Almost no more. Queen of Cincinnati is silly but has a ring to it.</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words"><em node="[object Object]" class="italic text-gray-800">Note: At this point, an entire season of different winners almost feels inevitable. If the No. 1 player in the world can lose her hands on the final green like that, then golf in 2025 on the LPGA Tour is officially a fever dream.</em></p>

It&#x27;s a nine-hole cut into a driftless hillside that asks little but gives plenty. From the tips it is a par 35 at 3,048 yards. No, it is not the kind of place a glossy brochure brags about, but the kind that matters. Where small wins last longer than your perfect drive that rolled down the slope again, and a $20 bill and a bit of time somehow deliver more than money ever should.</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">Walk past the sheds full of member golf carts, step into the little clubhouse, and you&#x27;ll find yourself offered a frozen Snickers, some used golf balls that yes, tumbled down the hill, and the chance to buy a hat with the town mascot, <a href="https://www.lodilakewisconsin.org/susie-the-duck/" node="[object Object]" class="text-primary-600 hover:text-primary-700 transition-colors duration-200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Susie the Duck</a>, on it. Look out the window and you&#x27;ll see the 9th green and catch something rarer: the sound of folks who play for the sake of it. Not networking, not prestige--just the pure, slightly crooked joy of seeing a golf ball tumble across land that has seen more deer than FootJoys.</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">The course itself? Well, &quot;National&quot; isn&#x27;t that much of a stretch. IT IS HARD. The night before a tee time, I&#x27;ll catch myself thinking about that opening hole, trying to will myself not to screw it up in the morning. No. 1 does not lull you into anything. It is tough, a 294-yard par-4 that ends in an elevated green where, if you miss, your ball lands in tall grass or rolls down the slope never to be seen again. Each hole has its quirks, and quirks, I&#x27;d argue, are better than pedigree. No. 2 is a sharp 90-degree dogleg right, framed by hickory trees waiting in the rough. The 434-yard No. 5 doglegs just enough to dare you into a mistake. Your approach shot there then must carry or avoid the &quot;lake&quot; that the entire course slopes to. No. 7 feels uphill even when it&#x27;s not. You can hit a beautiful drive and still never find your ball, which somehow flew over the berm and disappeared even though you swore it landed in the middle of the fairway.</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words"><img src="/optimized/7-marie.webp" alt="Marie on Lodi&#x27;s 7th fairway"/></p>

<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">Then comes the pièce de résistance: the 8th hole, a 305-yard par 4. Go for the drive and you&#x27;ll likely greet the old-growth oaks, sending your ball into some rabbit territory. Play it safe and lay up short of the trees, only to have it roll down the slope anyway. The best I&#x27;ve ever managed here? A 19-degree 3-hybrid striped straight, then some imitation Lee Trevino 9-iron chip to get onto the green but not too much speed that it rolls off the backside. All while the beauty of the Wisconsin River stretches out below and a red-tailed hawk stares through you from above.</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">And when you&#x27;ve survived that, you&#x27;re nearly home! No. 9, with the clubhouse staring you down, you remember this isn&#x27;t Pinehurst—it&#x27;s Lodi, and par carries its own kind of nobility that comes with a Miller Lite.</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">There are fancier courses, yes. Straighter fairways, faster greens, locker rooms with cold, fragrant towels. But none of them give you what Lodi National does: a front-row seat to the small, essential theater of people simply trying--sometimes failing, often laughing--to get the ball in the hole.</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">And that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a nine-hole kingdom.

<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">Gigi Stoll delivered the best round of her LPGA career to end the day two off Chanette Wannasaen with a 7-under 65.</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">The Oregon native has had a season of mixed results up to this point. She&#x27;s made six cuts in sixteen starts before this week, but she certainly had a first-round breakthrough to shake the concerns.</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">&quot;I&#x27;ve kind of had a little bit of a struggle golf-wise, but my personal life has been really good,&quot; Stoll said after the round. &quot;The dots are finally connecting, and I&#x27;ve been putting myself in position to play good. Today, I did that.&quot;</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">Though Stoll parred her first four, she then went birdie-birdie at the par-3 fifth and par-5 sixth, then added another at the eighth. After another birdie at 10, she landed arguably the overall highlight of her and THE day -- an eagle at the par-5 11th -- and even just watching digital leaderboards, a fan could feel the momentum shift.</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">She briefly gave one back at 17, but in proper fashion, she piped a drive on 18 and closed with a birdie. Yup. $</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">Thailand&#x27;s Chanettee Wannasaen grabbed the early lead with a 9-under 63, tying the 18-hole tournament scoring record. She went bogey-free, carding one eagle and seven birdies.</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">Around them, Nelly Korda performed well. A dialed iron game helped her finish with a 67 despite 3 bogeys.</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">Not everyone had it working -- Fiona Xu struggled mightily, finishing +17 before withdrawing from the event.</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">But day one in Queen City still felt like it belonged to Stoll. She played with confidence, and from the scores it was clear she knew she could stay on the leaderboard.</p>

<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">River’s Bend isn’t new to big stages. The course hosted the PGA TOUR Champions Kroger Classic, the Korn Ferry Tour’s Chiquita Classic, and the Epson Tour’s Prasco Charity Championship. Built in 2001, it’s an Arnold Palmer and Ed Seay course that asks players to hit every shot in the bag and has been called one of the best new private clubs in the country. It’s big enough for the crowds and precise enough to expose mistakes. It should be a compelling canvas for where the leaderboard will shift from day to day, and you’ll see desperate charges just to cling to the cut, along with the kind of bottom-of-the-board wreckage that draws out the morbidly curious.</p>

It winds through woods and wildflowers, and you&#x27;ll often have doves perched on the edges of the greens, cooing for you to sink that very miss-able putt after your tee shot sat ten feet from the pin. Meanwhile, a shirtless man with a gold Rolex and a bag light with just a 4-hybrid, wedge, and blade putter, looking like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpBRiMrpdWU" node="[object Object]" class="text-primary-600 hover:text-primary-700 transition-colors duration-200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pat Simmons if he&#x27;d chosen to haunt muni fairways</a>, gives you a squint. He doesn&#x27;t need to speak; the glance alone makes you question why you ever called ahead for a tee time at a place where nobody does, while also letting you know you&#x27;ve stumbled into somewhere loose, free, and wonderful.</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">It&#x27;s not long at 2,717 yards, but the holes will make you miss, make you feel like you&#x27;re playing golf rather than navigating a spreadsheet. A slice right on 7, and it disappears into the water, ready for some Thursday morning league player with a ball retriever to rescue it. Pull one left and you&#x27;re tangled in tall prairie grasses and wandering turkeys. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re young or old, seasoned or brand new--anyone who&#x27;s ever picked up a club will find themselves at home here and loving every moment of it.</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words"><a href="https://www.cityofmadison.com/parks/golf/courses/glen" node="[object Object]" class="text-primary-600 hover:text-primary-700 transition-colors duration-200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Glen Golf Park in Madison</a> doesn&#x27;t feel city-bound at all, especially after its 2022 reopening. Even though it sits right in town, &quot;The Glen&quot; is quiet and tucked away, the kind of place where you can nearly forget you have neighbors. The closest are Forest Hill Cemetery, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheVillageBar/?_rdr" node="[object Object]" class="text-primary-600 hover:text-primary-700 transition-colors duration-200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Village Bar</a>, and the squirrels leaping through giant oak trees. Hole 5 feels like a quest. It&#x27;s 443 yards to the pin--your drive carries over a stretch of prairie, then tumbles down a hill, threads a ravine framed by oaks, and climbs back up to an elevated green. It isn&#x27;t a course you just play; it&#x27;s one you explore. Every hole gives you something different. The rises and drops test your swing, and the tricky greens can turn a simple chip into a triple bogey. The four par-3s slip through native grasses, less like golf holes and more like puzzles. The payoff isn&#x27;t just the shots you hit well; it&#x27;s the walk itself. The smell of flowers in the air. Sunlight flashing off your ball like it belongs in the landscape. Late in the day, you might spot locals lining up putts, trading childhood stories from playing hide and seek in the cemetery next door or remembering how Glenway used to be.</p>

<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words"><em node="[object Object]" class="italic text-gray-800">See Golfers Play at The Glen Golf Park from Village Bar</em></p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">These are places where golf actually works. Compact, untamed, forgiving when it needs to be, harsh when it doesn&#x27;t.</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">Then there are the places that boast about being 18-hole championship courses. The kind taken straight from graph paper to bulldozer: efficient, maybe, but infinitely humorless. One straight par-4 after another, bunkers left and right, and throngs that can seem allergic to common courtesy. Everything gleams except the golf, and some of the people. Like the employee who must mention to one and all their &quot;executive course, if you want something easier.&quot; Nope. I just want a beer, my clubs, and a walk through the woods. No rangefinder-waving guy blasting Kid Rock from a Bluetooth speaker. No polishing off a sixth double transfusion. Just me, the trees, and the quiet.</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">Sure, these places have perfect surfaces, perfect angles, every hole designed to look like it belongs on a magazine cover and just about as horizontal, too. Fun for an afternoon, sure, but when everything is nudged toward non-technical, perfectly manicured holes the game also flattens out. Golf isn&#x27;t a photo-op where you strut around in PXG polos, careen your cart across the fairway, and throw off my wife&#x27;s approach shot. It&#x27;s meant to be a little remote, a little frustrating, and a lot grounding.</p>
<p node="[object Object]" class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 mb-6 last:mb-0 font-lock-lg break-words">Warnimont and Glenway understand something simple: limits are essential. Some unstated courtesy and sedateness are essential. They force creativity, invite fun, and make a short round feel long, a simple hole feels alive and the whole thing a pleasurable experience. The wild and maybe even a little weird municipal. A thing you walk off feeling like you did something--that&#x27;s the one that earns your love. Not the polished, soulless mega-course that fills social media feeds. As our friend Max James likes to put it, &quot;These places aren&#x27;t really courses at all, they&#x27;re vibes.&quot;</p></div></div><div class="text-left"><a class="text-primary-500 hover:text-primary-600 font-medium text-base inline-flex items-center" href="/news/muni-gems/">Read article →</a></div></article></div></section></main><aside class="w-full lg:w-80 flex-shrink-0"><div class="lg:sticky lg:top-24"><section class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6"><h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Latest News</h2><div class="space-y-4"><div class="border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-4 bg-white hover:shadow-md transition-shadow"><a class="block" href="/news/queen-city-2025/"><div class="flex gap-3"><div class="flex-shrink-0"><div class="w-16 h-16 bg-gray-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden"><img alt="TPC River&#x27;s Bend" loading="lazy" width="64" height="64" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="w-full h-full object-cover" style="color:transparent" src="/optimized/queen-city.webp"/></div></div><div class="flex-1 min-w-0 overflow-hidden"><div class="mb-1"><span class="inline-block text-primary-500 font-semibold text-xs border-b border-primary-500 pb-1">Tournament Preview</span></div><h3 class="font-medium text-gray-900 mb-1 line-clamp-2 hover:text-primary-500 transition-colors break-words">Kroger Queen City Preview: Storylines, Standouts, and How to Watch</h3><div class="flex items-center gap-2 text-xs text-gray-500 mb-1 flex-wrap"><span>By <!-- -->George Hack</span><span>•</span><span>September 9, 2025</span><span>•</span><span>3<!-- --> min read</span></div><p class="text-xs text-gray-600 line-clamp-2 break-words">The 2025 Kroger Queen City Championship lands at TPC River’s Bend this week, bringing 144 of the world’s best for a $2 million purse and a season still without a repeat winner. Defending champ Lydia Ko, world No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul, Minjee Lee, and Monday qualifiers Heather Lin and Polly Mack will all be jockeying for position on a course that rewards precision and punishes mistakes.

was a silence on the 18th green at TPC River's Bend late Sunday. This wasn't the kind of Sunday for ice cream at [Charley's Mini Golf](https://www.instagram.com/p/DMlTbKKN7h2/?hl=en\u0026img_index=1). Spectators weren't whispering; they were holding their breath. Charley Hull found herself with a short putt to win her third LPGA event, yet the story wasn't just about her ball. It was also about one that had just rolled and rolled far too many times off the putter of the world's best player. [Jeeno Thitikul had just four-putted](https://youtube.com/shorts/t3uoJslHLS4?si=mcb089QgETyd1Vjx) from a range that should've been routine, her last stroke a decelerated push. It was a tragedy that makes even casual fans wince and think to themselves, \"She's one of us.\" \r\n\r\nThe crowd looked ill, and Hull incredulous.\r\n\r\nShe stepped away from her own putt twice, plumb bobbed her [TP Hydro Blast](https://www.taylormadegolf.com/TP-Hydro-Blast-Soto-/DW-TA327.html?lang=en_US) like she was lining up a bet she couldn't afford to lose, then rolled it. Dead center. Pin still in as always. And with that, she won her first event of 2025.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't really process it,\" Hull said afterward. \"Jeeno played great today. She was very solid. Unfortunate what happened to her on the last hole. At the end of the day, I just felt like I needed a little bit of luck on my side in the last few years because I don't feel like it's ever gone my way and it's finally got my way for once. Every dog has its day.\"\r\n\r\nIt had been 1,077 days since Hull's last LPGA win, at the Volunteers of America Classic in 2022. She made sure to end the drought in style—posting rounds of 68-65-67-68 to finish 20-under 268 and collect $300,000.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the final round was a duel long before they walked up to 18. Hull started with the lead but slipped a shot behind on 14 when Thitikul rolled in a birdie. [She answered on 16, sinking a long birdie putt](https://youtu.be/M1SAih6OXUQ?t=244) after splashing it in the bunker off the tee. She then gave it right back with a bogey at 17. Thitikul's steady par there sent her to the last with a one-shot cushion. Hull admitted she thought she had to eagle the 18th just to have a chance.\r\n\r\n\"On 18, pushed my driver a little bit. Hit a nice cut 9-iron round the tree. Didn't quite cut. Thought I had to hole the putt and just two-putted,\" Hull said. \"I don't really remember much from the last hole. It was a little bit of a shock. I was nervous over that putt. My hands were shaking. I think I was more shocked, and the adrenaline and everything.\"\r\n\r\nI called Hull the [\"Queen of the Almost\"](https://www.birdiebriefing.com/news/charley-hull-queen-almost/) earlier this summer, after she'd managed to collect her runner-up at the AIG Women's Open at Porthcawl. Her road to this moment hasn't been smooth. She battled injuries all season—torn ankle ligaments, a back injury from lifting a box, and even a virus that caused her to withdraw from Evian after she fainted. When asked if she plays better hurt, Hull didn't hesitate: \"It slows my mind down. I always find when I'm poorly, ill, I usually play good golf. My mind is 100 miles an hour, but when I'm poorly, I find I'm more relaxed, and I probably expect less and do less. My days are usually full out, going to the gym, golf, practice. When I'm kind of poorly or injured I do a lot less and I put less pressure on myself. Then I kind of do better sometimes.\"\r\n\r\nThis is all on brand for Charley Hull: she doesn't just play; she insists on being part of the story. She's aggressive off the tee, unafraid to fire at pins, and when she's on, you're captivated.\r\n\r\nWas this win gift-wrapped by Thitikul's collapse? Absolutely. But Hull had to be there to capitalize on it.\r\n\r\nQueen of the Almost no more. Queen of Cincinnati is silly but has a ring to it.\r\n\r\n*Note: At this point, an entire season of different winners almost feels inevitable. If the No. 1 player in the world can lose her hands on the final green like that, then golf in 2025 on the LPGA Tour is officially a fever dream.*\r\n\r\n## Round 4 Competition Highlights\r\n\r\nSee story above!\r\n\r\n## Shout Out\r\n\r\n**Jeeno Thitikul** for being gracious in her loss.\r\n\r\n## Gear Notes\r\n\r\nNothing of major note from round 4."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"23:Tda5,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"There are certain courses that make no sense on paper or even when you're standing on the first tee but feel just right when you're actually playing in them. [Lodi Golf Club, though colloquially we've taken to calling it Lodi National](http://www.lodigolf.com/), is exactly that kind of place. It's a nine-hole cut into a driftless hillside that asks little but gives plenty. From the tips it is a par 35 at 3,048 yards. No, it is not the kind of place a glossy brochure brags about, but the kind that matters. Where small wins last longer than your perfect drive that rolled down the slope again, and a $20 bill and a bit of time somehow deliver more than money ever should.\r\n\r\nWalk past the sheds full of member golf carts, step into the little clubhouse, and you'll find yourself offered a frozen Snickers, some used golf balls that yes, tumbled down the hill, and the chance to buy a hat with the town mascot, [Susie the Duck](https://www.lodilakewisconsin.org/susie-the-duck/), on it. Look out the window and you'll see the 9th green and catch something rarer: the sound of folks who play for the sake of it. Not networking, not prestige--just the pure, slightly crooked joy of seeing a golf ball tumble across land that has seen more deer than FootJoys.\r\n\r\nThe course itself? Well, \"National\" isn't that much of a stretch. IT IS HARD. The night before a tee time, I'll catch myself thinking about that opening hole, trying to will myself not to screw it up in the morning. No. 1 does not lull you into anything. It is tough, a 294-yard par-4 that ends in an elevated green where, if you miss, your ball lands in tall grass or rolls down the slope never to be seen again. Each hole has its quirks, and quirks, I'd argue, are better than pedigree. No. 2 is a sharp 90-degree dogleg right, framed by hickory trees waiting in the rough. The 434-yard No. 5 doglegs just enough to dare you into a mistake. Your approach shot there then must carry or avoid the \"lake\" that the entire course slopes to. No. 7 feels uphill even when it's not. You can hit a beautiful drive and still never find your ball, which somehow flew over the berm and disappeared even though you swore it landed in the middle of the fairway.\r\n\r\n![Marie on Lodi's 7th fairway](/optimized/7-marie.webp)\r\n\r\n*Marie on Lodi's 7th fairway*\r\n\r\nThen comes the pièce de résistance: the 8th hole, a 305-yard par 4. Go for the drive and you'll likely greet the old-growth oaks, sending your ball into some rabbit territory. Play it safe and lay up short of the trees, only to have it roll down the slope anyway. The best I've ever managed here? A 19-degree 3-hybrid striped straight, then some imitation Lee Trevino 9-iron chip to get onto the green but not too much speed that it rolls off the backside.

She's made six cuts in sixteen starts before this week, but she certainly had a first-round breakthrough to shake the concerns.\r\n\r\n\"I've kind of had a little bit of a struggle golf-wise, but my personal life has been really good,\" Stoll said after the round. \"The dots are finally connecting, and I've been putting myself in position to play good.

After another birdie at 10, she landed arguably the overall highlight of her and THE day -- an eagle at the par-5 11th -- and even just watching digital leaderboards, a fan could feel the momentum shift.\r\n\r\nShe briefly gave one back at 17, but in proper fashion, she piped a drive on 18 and closed with a birdie.

The course hosted the PGA TOUR Champions Kroger Classic, the Korn Ferry Tour’s Chiquita Classic, and the Epson Tour’s Prasco Charity Championship.

The closest are Forest Hill Cemetery, the [Village Bar](https://www.facebook.com/TheVillageBar/?_rdr), and the squirrels leaping through giant oak trees. Hole 5 feels like a quest. It's 443 yards to the pin--your drive carries over a stretch of prairie, then tumbles down a hill, threads a ravine framed by oaks, and climbs back up to an elevated green. It isn't a course you just play; it's one you explore. Every hole gives you something different. The rises and drops test your swing, and the tricky greens can turn a simple chip into a triple bogey. The four par-3s slip through native grasses, less like golf holes and more like puzzles. The payoff isn't just the shots you hit well; it's the walk itself. The smell of flowers in the air.

Compact, untamed, forgiving when it needs to be, harsh when it doesn't.\r\n\r\nThen there are the places that boast about being 18-hole championship courses. The kind taken straight from graph paper to bulldozer: efficient, maybe, but infinitely humorless. One straight par-4 after another, bunkers left and right, and throngs that can seem allergic to common courtesy. Everything gleams except the golf, and some of the people. Like the employee who must mention to one and all their \"executive course, if you want something easier.\" Nope. I just want a beer, my clubs, and a walk through the woods. No rangefinder-waving guy blasting Kid Rock from a Bluetooth speaker. No polishing off a sixth double transfusion. Just me, the trees, and the quiet.\r\n\r\nSure, these places have perfect surfaces, perfect angles, every hole designed to look like it belongs on a magazine cover and just about as horizontal, too. Fun for an afternoon, sure, but when everything is nudged toward non-technical, perfectly manicured holes the game also flattens out. Golf isn't a photo-op where you strut around in PXG polos, careen your cart across the fairway, and throw off my wife's approach shot. It's meant to be a little remote, a little frustrating, and a lot grounding.\r\n\r\nWarnimont and Glenway understand something simple: limits are essential. Some unstated courtesy and sedateness are essential. They force creativity, invite fun, and make a short round feel long, a simple hole feels alive and the whole thing a pleasurable experience. The wild and maybe even a little weird municipal. A thing you walk off feeling like you did something--that's the one that earns your love.

And yeah, it is. But the part that sticks with you long after the round is human. It's in laughter after a terrible swing. The quiet wins no one records on a phone or scorecard. The rituals that shape who we are long before we ever step onto a course.\r\n\r\nThat's why, when Grant Boone mentioned Jeongeun Lee5 is on YouTube, I had to check it out. What I found isn't just compelling. It's transformative.\r\n\r\nHer [FIVE STAR channel](https://www.youtube.com/@이정은빠이브) has been on a tear lately with content from [Amundi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQt2KDElefA), [Standard Portland Classic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxAExOCRHWg), [CPKC Women's Open](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlK5GaBejw), and the [FM Championship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suAXJt4H75k) but the videos also reveal something bigger than her skill with a golf club. Lee5 is a storyteller, a daughter, a cultural bridge. She's a woman in golf who plays with authority but moves through the game with playful ease and a lot of joy.\r\n\r\nTake the finale of her first season, [\"Tour Is My Life (Season 1 Finale) – Women are Power!\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdKOM4l1SM8\u0026t=1s) She spends a day on the course with her mother. It's not a lesson. It's a window into a life: teasing, care, warmth, playful banter. At one point, they argue over a missed putt, laugh, and then later share a bowl of kimchi jjigae. It's ordinary, it's tender, it's unforgettable. Beneath it all runs a current of love you can feel through the segment.\r\n\r\nAnd it's the little things that hit hardest. Snacks pulled from her bag. Quick glances exchanged mid-round. A double bogey earns a laugh. A par brings quiet satisfaction. Golf and life aren't separate for her, they're braided together. Moments carry something familiar, human, and unpolished. They're refreshingly different from the usual LPGA highlights or standard player press coverage.\r\n\r\nYes, she's a world-class athlete. Her swing is sharp, her strategy deliberate, her poise undeniable. But she never frames her talent as untouchable. She's extraordinary, yes, but fully human: joyful, grounded, approachable. That duality is special.\r\n\r\nWatching her reminds me that I, the Birdie Briefing, or you don't need a big plan to grow the exposure of the LPGA. Almost like a, \"Hey, forget all that. Just start. Drive a car to a tournament course. Eat food with your mom. Sit on a stairwell waiting out a rain delay. Show young people at the course that they belong there. The gestures don't have to be polished. They just have to be real. They just have to be in the ether.\"\r\n\r\nIt hits me in a way like when my friends play without keeping score: Inclusive. Joyful. Silly. Markedly human. You don't need an actual goal or mission statement all the time. You need curiosity, care, and the courage to do something. That's it.\r\n\r\nHer channel really is essential viewing. For fans, players, anyone who wants to see golf fully realized. To watch is to be invited into her world.

The 15th hole nearly unraveled her—an errant fairway shot, a rare flash of urgency, and a break from her usual pre-shot routine led to bogey, dropping her a shot behind Thitikul. But Wang steadied herself quickly: she brushed off a missed birdie on 16, then answered with a flawless approach to six feet on 17 and buried the putt to retake the lead. Thitikul, meanwhile, blinked—her chip skidding across the green and setting up a bogey.\r\n\r\n“I felt like this could be my week,” Wang said, recalling how her front-nine 29 on Thursday set the tone. “The shots and putts were going so well for me… I just worked really hard and didn’t give up on that.” A composed two-putt par on 18 sealed her 20-under 268 and a $615,000 winner’s check, punctuated by champagne showers from Rose Zhang, her final-round partner and longtime friend.\r\n\r\nThe win is another step in an impressive journey. Wang helped the Blue Devils capture the 2019 NCAA team title, was the 2022 WAPT Player of the Year, and now joins Shanshan Feng and Ronni Yin as one of China’s LPGA champions—while also becoming the fourth Duke alum to win on tour.\r\n\r\nThitikul, sharp as ever with her irons and putter, finished a shot back at 19 under. Sei Young Kim took solo third, Andrea Lee fourth, and Jin Hee Im tied with Rose Zhang for fifth after a record-tying 10-under 62 on Sunday.\r\n\r\nIt all underscores the LPGA’s depth this year: 24 winners across 23 events. Wang’s performance adds another, now including 7 rookies.\r\n\r\n“Winning on the LPGA has been my dream since I was eight,” Wang said. “I hope this is just the first of many, and I’ll keep pushing myself.” At The FM Championship, her patience, precision, and determination came together beautifully.

Wang let birdies come to her. She opened with one at the second, picked off three more on the front, and then let the back nine bloom: 12, 14, and the closer at 18. When her final putt dropped, the gallery gave her an almost riotous cheer.\r\n\r\nThis stage is a long way from where Wang was a year ago, grinding on partial status and unsure of her next purchase.

Now she stands at the front of a tournament that has already seen six rookies win this year, poised to make it seven.\r\n\r\n“Today’s performance was definitely a level all players aspire to achieve,” Wang said, smiling as though she knew how rare a day like this can be. “It feels really special to enter the finals as the leader. This is what we strive for every week, so I’m glad I did really well today. I hope I can keep this up.”\r\n\r\nThe challengers are not lightweights. Rose Zhang, calm as a metronome, posted six birdies against one bogey for a 67, her scorecard clean enough to put her at 15-under and tied for second with Sei Young Kim, who cooled with a 71. Jeeno Thitikul matched Wang’s fireworks with a 65 of her own, Andrea Lee added a 66, and both sit four back. Behind them, Kumkang Park surged with a 64, including an eagle on 4, to join Ayaka Furue (66) and Celine Borge (67) at 13-under.\r\n\r\nBy late afternoon, the shadows stretched long across the fairways, the crowd thinning into clusters around the 18th green.

Like she played screen golf with her friends and had some Chamisul for good measure. Eagle at the 2nd, birdie-birdie on 3 and 4, and just like that she took the lead away with another 65. It felt like the only way this fractured, stop-and-start round could end—jagged, a little surreal. I'm left drifting, wondering what on earth happened to Nelly Korda?\r\n\r\nEven now, I'm trying to make sense of what we saw on TPC Boston's 4th hole.

I should know better by now, after so many nights in the Boundary Waters, listening to wind howl and rain drum against a tarp while swaying in a hammock. You respect the weather, or it will cut you down. And on this day, the weather owned as much of the story as the golf itself. Players went out beneath heavy gray skies, only to be chased back by rolling thunderstorms. By the time the last horn blew at 7:15 p.m., the round was swallowed by darkness, with 72 players still on the course.\r\n\r\nAt 7 a.m. they picked up where they left off, closing out the second round before rolling into the third at 12:30. Which leaves us asking: what went down?\r\n\r\nJeeno Thitikul, the world's No. 1, also endured the stop-start pace. She sprinted down the ninth fairway with Green and defending champion Lauren Coughlin as dark clouds rolled in, hoping to beat the next horn. The Thai star finished with a 68, highlighted by four birdies on the back nine. Coughlin walked off with a 73, having double bogeyed the 17th.\r\n\r\nWe've mentioned her before, but Hannah Green—trying to shake off four straight missed cuts—finally found some rhythm as the thunder rolled. She rattled off five birdies to card a second-round 68, vaulting herself into contention at eight under.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Sweden's Madelene Sagstrom—maybe right at home in wind and driving rain—stayed in the hunt with a steady putting stroke, six birdies, and a flawless 66. A strong bounce-back after the double bogey on the 2nd hole yesterday.\r\n\r\nFinally, Rose Zhang showed the kind of calm, mature play you wouldn't expect from someone just 22. She racked up eight birdies, avoided a single bogey, and positioned herself in solo third at ten under. If she can keep that composure, the rest of the weekend could see her pressing Sei Young and contending for the win.\r\n\r\nWith the forecast calling for clearer skies, both tournament officials and players are optimistic about getting the schedule back on track for Saturday and Sunday.

Four players, and a rookie or two, had distinctive approaches to the course and the leaderboard.\r\n\r\nKorea's Sei Young Kim laid the groundwork, opening with a bogey-free 65. Her precision off the tee and approach shots left little room for error--she missed just two greens all day and hit eight approaches inside 20 feet. From 75–125 yards, her shots averaged just over 10 feet from the hole. Two birdies in the first four holes carried her through the round. \"All the birdies make me relax and have confidence,\" she said. \"Momentum's everything.\" Still, the elusive victory continues to slip through her fingers; Kim has 21 top-10s since 2021 but no win.\r\n\r\nAllisen Corpuz matched Kim's 65 to make a statement. From 150–175 yards, she averaged 23 feet to the hole and closed strong with birdies on 15, 16, and 17. \"I had a lot of looks and was able to convert,\" Corpuz said.\r\n\r\nAmerican Andrea Lee quietly kept pace with a bogey-free 67 of her own, continuing a run that has her ranked fifth on the LPGA Tour in strokes gained since May and 27 in the world ranking. Balanced iron play and solid putting kept her in contention, underscoring the value of consistency on a course like TPC Boston.\r\n\r\nA putter is a confidence machine, and even Nelly Korda isn't immune to its quirks. After losing her No. 1 ranking, she shelved the trusty Spider Tour X and slotted a TaylorMade Del Monte blade with adjustable weights into the bag--a little twist, a little gamble, and a whole lot of \"let's see what happens.\" Well, the swap worked: seven birdies and a 5-under 67. An early bogey at the 4th and another at the 10th didn't faze her. \"Just something new… different grip, different feel—I went with it,\" Korda said. Perhaps it’ll prove rewarding—her streak of made cuts remains unbroken, though that first win of the season still eludes her.\r\n\r\nJodi Ewart Shadoff made moves, birdying the final four holes of her round to join Kim and Corpuz atop the leaderboard at 7-under. Rookie Miranda Wang added flavor to the mix, finishing solo fourth at 6-under after eight birdies on the front nine.\r\n\r\nBy the close of play, TPC Boston had made its message clear: sharp iron play and confident putting were the keys to a low score. The leaders, having scoped the greens hole by hole, head into Round 2 with a strategy in place. More birdies, a handful of eagles, and a cutline around -1 are likely. It'll be tight, and with ESPN+ feature coverage, every shot will carry a little extra weight.\r\n\r\n## Round 1 Competition Highlights\r\n\r\n**Sei Young Kim** opens with bogey-free 65 with eight approaches inside 20 feet.\r\n\r\n**Allisen Corpuz** matches 65, finishes hot with birdies on 15–17.\r\n\r\n**Minjee Lee** with 209 feet of putts, including a 55-foot.\r\n\r\n**Andrea Lee** posts 67, showcasing steady, balanced play.\r\n\r\n**Nelly Korda** finds some rhythm with her putter shooting 5-under 67.\r\n\r\n**Jodi Ewart Shadoff** birdies final four holes to share 7-under lead.\r\n\r\n**Wei Wei Zhang** bounces back from recent missed cut, finishing 5-under with an eagle on hole 2.\r\n\r\n## Shout Out\r\n\r\nWe need to praise **Miranda Wang** for an incredible opening round—66 with nine birdies!

Arnold Palmer laid down the original plan in 2003, but four years later [Gil Hanse]( https://www.hansegolfdesign.com/) and PGA Tour player [Brad Faxon]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Faxon) were called in to rough it up. Their job was to make the course feel less like a set of lines on paper and more like a stretch of New England countryside you might wander across. They succeeded.\r\n\r\nDon’t let the pastoral charm fool you. TPC Boston has its tests, and they show most clearly at the 18th. Nicknamed the “Hell Hole,” it plays 504 yards for the tournament with \"birdie\" written on the scorecard, but it can easily wreck a round. Trouble lurks everywhere: bunkers right, slopes that reject even well-struck wedges. The hole has humbled more players than it has rewarded. Reach the green in one piece, and a par feels like a small victory; a birdie, a cause for celebration.

It was a duel. A final round that felt less like stroke play and more like match play, where every birdie and every answer from Minjee Lee hung heavy in the air. By the time Henderson rolled in her final putt and lifted the trophy, the Canadian galleries had their dream ending -- their star back on top, on home soil, for the first time in more than two years.\r\n\r\nHenderson's closing 4-under 67 at Mississaugua pushed her to 15 under, one shot clear of Lee's 68. The win marked her second CPKC Women's Open title, her 14th career victory on the LPGA Tour, and an emphatic end to a drought that had stretched across 64 starts.\r\n\r\n\"This week was beyond special,\" Henderson said, standing behind the 18th green. \"To be able to win my national open again, in front of these crowds… it feels surreal.\"\r\n\r\n**A Sunday Match Play**\r\n\r\nThe day began with Henderson and Lee tied at 11 under, three clear of the field. The crowd sensed it early: this was no longer a four-day tournament but a head-to-head contest between Canada's brightest star and one of the game's most polished champions.\r\n\r\nThe momentum swung like a pendulum. At the par-5 13th, Henderson nearly eagled but settled for birdie. Lee answered, rolling in her own. On the very next hole, the pivotal par-3 14th, Henderson made a pure 6-foot birdie putt for a one-stroke lead.\r\n\r\nThen came a behind the netter. On the 17th, with the gallery encircling the short par-4, Lee drained a 13-footer for birdie. The roar barely settled before Henderson stepped up and buried her own from 12 feet. Birdie for birdie.\r\n\r\nLee smiled. Henderson clenched her fist. The match ever so tilted Henderson's way. She carried that one-stroke edge to the house.\r\n\r\n\"I kind of got outplayed,\" Lee admitted, gracious in defeat. \"I did my job. But Brooke was just a little better today.\"\r\n\r\n**A Career Marker**\r\n\r\nFor Henderson, 27, the victory carries more weight than just number 14 on her career tally. This was her first title since the Diamond Resorts Tournament of Champions in January 2023, and it arrived after months of doubt, struggle, and slipping down the world rankings.\r\n\r\nShe is projected to leap back into the top 30 in the Race to CME Globe, securing her spot in the season-ending CME Group Tour Championship. More importantly, she reminded herself -- and everyone else -- what a locked-in Brooke Henderson looks like.\r\n\r\nWhen she first won this championship in 2018 at Wascana, she became the first Canadian in 45 years to lift the national title. To do it again, seven years later, in front of her home fans felt like the circle closing once more.\r\n\r\n\"I thought I might cry, honestly,\" Henderson said. \"It's just been so long. I felt like this week was meant to be.\"\r\n\r\nTo our Canadian friends across the Great Lakes, to the thunderous galleries, to those filling sports bars from coast to coast, and to the entire Canadian golf community -- bravo for the way you carried Henderson. Even her peers seemed to understand the weight of the moment. She had fought through doubts and close calls, only to find her game again when the stage demanded it. And so, a Canadian classic was written.\r\n\r\n## Round 4 Competition Highlights\r\n\r\n**Henderson's** birdie on 14 gave her the solo lead — and she never gave it back.\r\n\r\n**Minjee Lee** holed a birdie from 13 feet only for Henderson to answer immediately with her own from 12.\r\n\r\n**The galleries around Henderson were massive**, the kind of Canadian following that was Ryder Cup-sized at times.\r\n\r\n**Henderson's** up-and-downs on 15 and 16 held her lead steady in the tightest stretch of the round.\r\n\r\nFifteen-year-old phenom **Aphrodite Deng** tied for 20th at 4 under, capping a remarkable week.\r\n\r\n**Mao Saigo** finished third at 11 under.\r\n\r\n**Akie Iwai**, who led after two rounds, settled for fourth.\r\n\r\n## Shout Out\r\n\r\n**Canada's** steadfast support for its sports stars was nothing short of inspiring.\r\n\r\n## Gear Notes\r\n\r\nHenderson sealed the win playing a TaylorMade TP5x golf ball."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"30:T1558,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Henderson lit up the third round with a 6-under 65, capped by the kind of closing stretch that can tilt a tournament and change the mood of an entire gallery. She birdied the 15th and 16th, holed out from the greenside bunker on the short par-4 17th to ignite the crowd, and finished with a par on 18. Her father and longtime coach, Dave Henderson, even broke his usual stoicism with a rare celebration, pumping his arms as if even he couldn't hold back the noise. The finish pushed her to 11-under and tied with Minjee Lee for the lead.\r\n\r\nThe bunker shot on 17 was the day's defining moment, a piece of theater. Mississaugua's par-4 seventeenth doesn't look like much on the card, but standing on it in the heat of battle is something different. A big drive leaves only a wedge, and Henderson's left her approach in the front bunker, a tricky lie staring her down with the tournament hanging in the air. What came next was the kind of shot you remember years later: the crisp strike, the thump of sand, and the ball climbing out of the lip before landing soft and tracking straight into the hole. The roar sounded less like a golf clap and more like an arena crowd. Henderson called her round an \"A\" and admitted she was actually happy to see the ball end up in the sand, knowing she had the chance to pull something off.\r\n\r\nShe hasn't won since January 2023 or posted a top-10 this season, but her record is daunting: eight victories in her last 11 tries when holding at least a share of the lead heading into Sunday. History may not repeat, but it often rhymes, and Henderson has the kind of winning muscle memory that can carry her across a finish line.\r\n\r\nLee nearly matched Henderson with a 66, a round just as brilliant but built differently-- the kind of steady method she's made a career on. Two eagles, a birdie chip-in, and a deft par save at 18 filled her card. The Australian, who won the KPMG Women's PGA Championship in June, is chasing her 12th LPGA title and her second of the year. Her career has never been about flash, though the numbers say she belongs among the elite: two majors, a slew of wins across three continents, and a knack for playing her best when the courses demand discipline. After years of frustration with the putter, she's turned the switch to the long model into one of the season's most dangerous weapons. When the stroke is rolling, she doesn't just score; she squeezes the air out of the leaderboard.\r\n\r\nThree shots back, world No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul sits tied for third with Japan's Akie Iwai. Thitikul's steady 69 kept her in the mix, a quiet round that looked routine on the card but was anything but simple on a course where thick rough and uneven lies lurk at every corner. She carries herself like someone twice her age -- patient, precise, and never hurried -- which makes sense for a player who has spent most of her teenage years ranked inside the world's top five. Iwai, meanwhile, struggled early with 3 bogeys to start her round but steadied herself, and her firepower is the kind that can heat up quickly. Both players loom as serious Sunday dangers.\r\n\r\nCanadian amateur Aphrodite Deng shot 68 to reach 6-under, tied for seventh. She needed only 26 putts and continues to showcase a lethal wedge game. A top-12 finish would mark the best LPGA result by an amateur this season, adding another layer of intrigue to an already Canadian-heavy storyline. It isn't just Henderson carrying The Maple Leaf.\r\n\r\nFor Henderson, the opportunity is singular. A 13-time winner, she's looking to become the first Canadian to win her national open twice since 1914. Winning again, on home soil, would put her in rarefied company and cement her as the most accomplished Canadian player of any era.\r\n\r\nThe galleries will be hers on Sunday, and she knows it. \"Winning in 2018 was a huge career highlight,\" she said. \"To be in this position again is really, really cool. I just hope to get a fast start, make birdies, and get the crowd on my side.\"\r\n\r\nThe CPKC Women's Open has grown into something larger than a golf tournament. It carries identity, memory, and emotion—for the fans who fill the ropes as much as for the players inside them. Henderson and Lee have staged a duel worthy of the spotlight, with world No. 1 Thitikul and a fearless amateur close enough to change the script. Whether it finishes in maple-leaf triumph or an Australian claim, Mississaugua is set to deliver a champion in major fashion.\r\n\r\n## Round 3 Competition Highlights\r\n\r\n**Brooke Henderson** shot 6-under 65, including a holed bunker shot for eagle on 17.\r\n\r\n**Minjee Lee** carded a 66 with two eagles (12 and 17) and a par-saving chip-in at 18.\r\n\r\n**Jeeno Thitikul** three shots back at 8-under after a steady 69. She recorded five birdies.\r\n\r\n**Akie Iwai** dropped to a 72 on Saturday but tied for third at 8-under.\r\n\r\n**Aphrodite Deng** needed just 26 putts, converting nearly every look inside 15 feet.\r\n\r\n**Leona Maguire** nearly aced the par-3 6th hole.\r\n\r\n**Yu Liu** shot a 67 on Saturday to climb into contention at 7-under.\r\n\r\n**Pajaree Anannarukarn** is not in contention but leads the Audi Precision Award with 43 greens in regulation.\r\n\r\n## Shout Out\r\n\r\n**Brooke Henderson** launching her TaylorMade Qi35 like a puck off the ice.

Mississaugua’s first crack at hosting the CPKC Women’s Open showed off quick greens, heavy rough, and a layout built that demanded patience while keeping eagles and birdies hard-earned.\r\n\r\nAkie Iwai, fresh off her breakthrough in Portland, continued her strong play and aggressive style. It occasionally cost her. Even so, she closed the day with a steady 2-under 69 to build a three-shot cushion at 9-under, though afterward she admitted to leaving too many birdie chances on the table.\r\n\r\nLeona Maguire, one of the most consistent drivers on tour, delivered several long-range putts to stay in contention despite battling with the flatstick at shorter range. Australia’s Minjee Lee and world No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul joined Maguire in the chasing pack at 6-under.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was Brooke Henderson. Even the winningest golfer in Canadian history can still look like she’s cramming for the exam, and Friday was a case study. Henderson, cheered on by the largest gallery of the day, turned in a 5-under 66 that vaulted her 33 spots up the board and away from the cut line that had been uncomfortably close. “I just wanted to get away from the cut line as fast as I could,” she said afterward, and did so with the casual urgency of someone checking their rearview mirror, then stomping on the gas. Any time Henderson’s name creeps near the top of the board on Canadian soil, the energy follows—loud, expectant, and full of possibility.\r\n\r\nStacy Lewis showed her veteran poise with a clever recovery from a penalty area to save par, while Sweden’s Linnea Ström nearly jarred an approach at 17. Young Canadian amateur Aphrodite Deng and Québec’s Maude-Aimée Leblanc brought local flavor to the pairings. Fifteen-year-old Deng cooled off after her electric opening round but still held her ground at 3-under, another reminder that the country's future talent isn't stuck on the bench or skating the second line anymore; she's already teeing it up under the spotlight.\r\n\r\nFor the weekend, the greens are smooth enough to make a Zamboni driver smile. Iwai holds the lead, Henderson is charging, and the leaderboard is the kind of Saturday puzzle that makes a national championship worth following. With narrow margins, a raucous crowd, veterans holding steady, and young guns pressing, the CPKC Women’s Open heads into the final 36 holes wide open and ready for a thrilling finish.\r\n\r\n## Round 2 Competition Highlights\r\n\r\n**Akie Iwai** shot a 2-under 69 to take a three-stroke lead at 9-under par.\r\n\r\nCanadian fan favorite **Brooke Henderson** made a massive leap up the leaderboard with a 5-under 66, moving 33 spots away from the cut line.\r\n\r\n**Maude-Aimée Leblanc**, the Quebec native, who has battled injuries, made a clutch putt, demonstrating the progress she's made.\r\n\r\n**Leona Maguire, Minjee Lee, and Jeeno Thitikul** are all tied for second at 6-under, setting up a thrilling final 36 holes.\r\n\r\n**Stacy Lewis** saved par with a crafty shot from a penalty area, earning one of the loudest applauses of the day.\r\n\r\n**Linnea Ström** nearly holed out at 17, showcasing sharp iron play.\r\n\r\n**Yan Liu** posted a four-under round with excellent pace on the greens, moving up the leaderboard.\r\n\r\n## Shout Out\r\n\r\nTo Course Superintendent **Jon Smith** and his crew.

Familiar champions like Jin Young Ko and Nelly Korda went searching for form, Akie Iwai posted a flawless 64 to take the solo lead, and a 15-year-old Canadian amateur with an unshakable stare stole much of the spotlight.\r\n\r\nJin Young Ko--once unstoppable, now two years removed from her last win looked steady, carding 5 birdies, including the par 5s of 12 and 13. Showing the pinpoint iron play that earned her the world No. 1 spot in 2020, this is the same player who went bogey-free over 72 holes to claim this event in 2019--and she’s signaling she could do it again.\r\n\r\nNelly Korda, meanwhile, is still chasing her first victory of 2025 after piling up seven a year ago. Her round was a blend of sharp birdies and a rare stumble at the 175-yard par-3 third. Still, she exhibited the brilliance that makes her game so unmistakable--none better than a wedge from 81 yards that back-spun into easy scoring range. The mudball she faced at 11, the toughest hole of the day, was the kind of bad break that can throw off rhythm, but she salvaged enough to save par.\r\n\r\nAnd then there's sponsor invitee Aphrodite Deng, the Canadian amateur who plays like she's seen this stage before. Just 15 years old and already a U.S. Girls' Junior champion, she led stretches of the day with poise beyond her years. She hit nearly every fairway, stuck approaches close, and even when she missed, her recovery shots carried quiet confidence. Whether it's adrenaline or just youth, Deng hasn't blinked. Six birdies and a first-round 66 have her sitting T2, making her Canadian debut a national storyline.\r\n\r\nMegan Kang, 2023's CPKC winner in Vancouver, kept herself firmly in the mix with three birdies in four holes. Kang knows this golf course, knows the pressure, and still makes it look routine. Her controlled fades off the tee and steady putting kept her close to the leader.\r\n\r\nOther names surfaced and impressed: Gaby Lopez, showing graceful touch, finished her round tied for second with 7 birdies; rookie Ina Yoon grinding out pars from thick Canadian rough; and Taiwan's Chien Peiyun carded a 68 thanks to her crisp ball striking.\r\n\r\nThe greens rolled pure--\"smooth,\" one player said--rewarding aggressive iron play but punishing hesitation. Several players noted switching to firmer wedges this week to handle the tight and muddy fringes. Together, the field and Mississaugua produced exactly the kind of test you'd expect from an LPGA stage of this caliber.\r\n\r\n## Round 1 Competition Highlights\r\n\r\n**Jin Young Ko's** birdie run included a sharp seven-iron at 16 to set up her fourth birdie of the day, showing flashes of her 2019 Ontario form.\r\n\r\n**Gaby Lopez** recorded six birdies in her final 10 holes, tying for the most birdies in the field on Thursday with seven.\r\n\r\n**Nelly Korda** recovered from a shaky approach on 11 with a perfectly flighted 81-yard wedge at 12 that spun to four feet, keeping her in contention.\r\n\r\n**Jeeno Thitikul** also at T2, shot six birdies over her last 10 holes, including back-to-back birdies on Nos. 3-4 and 9-10. It was her first start at the CPKC Women's Open since moving to Rolex No. 1.\r\n\r\n**Aphrodite Deng**, the 15-year-old amateur, hit nearly every fairway and dropped just one bogey, holding her ground against seasoned winners and ended R1 as the lowest Canadian in the field.\r\n\r\n**Megan Kang**, last year's champion, climbed the board with a burst of birdies on the back nine, demonstrating comfort and poise at Mississaugua.\r\n\r\n**Soo Bin Joo** sits 7th at four under, citing improvements in mental game, swing, putting, and chipping for her solid round.\r\n\r\n**Leona Maguire** sits T2 after a 66, posting six birdies against one bogey. She missed just one fairway, birdied it, and praised the smooth greens for giving herself plenty of scoring opportunities.\r\n\r\n**Yuna Nishimura** electrified the gallery with a long birdie putt that rolled true, a reminder of her fearless putting stroke.\r\n\r\n**Hae Ran Ryu** displayed precise iron play with aggressive wedge shots into tucked pins, earning multiple birdies.\r\n\r\n**Lindy Duncan** clanged her approach off the flagstick at 16, striking the cup so sharply it dented the metal.\r\n\r\n## Shout Out\r\n\r\nPuppy pets to Blue, the German Shepherd-Malinois mix from the [Halton Regional Police Service](https://www.haltonpolice.ca/en/index.aspx), for holding down duties as the official course dog.\r\n\r\nHats off to the [local cormorant](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Double-crested_Cormorant/overview) feasting on Credit River catfish.

Henderson's 2018 triumph at this championship remains one of the defining moments in Canadian sport, ending a 45-year drought and being the first national win since Jocelyne Bourassa in 1973. She leads a group of Canadians in the field, each chasing that same dream of lifting their country's championship trophy on home soil (maybe sneaking in a few celebratory Tim Hortons Timbiebs for good measure).\r\n\r\n**The World's Best Are Back**\r\n\r\n[Newly crowned No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul](https://www.birdiebriefing.com/news/jeeno-thitikul-quiet-stride/) makes her first start since climbing past Nelly Korda in the rankings.

Now, back in Canada to defend, she brings momentum with her, a T7 finish last week in Portland.\r\n\r\n**Sponsor Invitees**\r\n\r\nThe championship has also welcomed sponsor invites that ensure the next wave has its chance to shine. Ontario's Alena Sharp and Quebec's Maude-Aimée Leblanc are in the field, joined by rising amateurs like Anna Davis, Carla Bernat Escuder, and U.S. Women's Amateur champion Megha Ganne.\r\n\r\n**Sustainable Approach**\r\n\r\nGolf Canada is raising the bar on sustainability at the Open, aiming to make the tournament zero-waste and carbon-neutral. Partnering with the Green Event Ninjas, the event has already diverted 75% of waste, recycled thousands of kilograms of material, and eliminated nearly 68,000 single-use water bottles. With fans encouraged to bike, carpool, and engage in eco-friendly practices, the Open is setting a new standard for environmental responsibility.\r\n\r\n**Be Part of It**\r\n\r\nThe CPKC Women's Open is a full-on festival for fans of all ages, and this year there are plenty of ways to make your tournament experience unforgettable.

Then she watched her twin sister, Chisato, sip champagne in Mexico while she smiled through the twinge of being the other half of the story. On Sunday in Portland, she finally got to write her own ending.\r\n\r\nThe 23-year-old rookie from Saitama closed with a bogey-free 66 to win The Standard Portland Classic by four, finishing at 24-under. Six birdies and no errors -- the kind of round players dream about but rarely manage when it matters most. She birdied Nos. 5 and 6 to settle herself, then went about the back nine like a painter, deliberate and precise in her strokes. She sealed the victory with birdies on 17 and 18, the last an 18-footer that rolled in with the composure of a player who had already made up her mind about the outcome.\r\n\r\nThat's when sister Chisato came running across the green, champagne bottle in hand. If the LPGA is still searching for its next great sibling storyline, it found it in that moment -- a younger sister by sixty seconds dousing her twin in fizzy, French affirmation.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the field deserves their ink. American Gurleen Kaur posted her career-best finish, runner-up at 20-under, and appeared like a player eager to keep going if only there had been a fifth round to play. Linn Grant shared third with Chisato, and Grace Kim stayed in the conversation at 18-under. Even Oregon amateur Kiara Romero made noise with a 64 and a tie for seventh, giving the local Ducks faithful a glimpse of the future. But in truth, the week belonged to Akie.\r\n\r\nHer win folds neatly into a larger Japanese surge on tour this year. She became the fifth from her country to win in 2025, joining Chisato, Rio Takeda, Mao Saigo, and British Open champion Miyu Yamashita. It feels less like coincidence and more like a movement, each name sharpening the edge of Japanese golf. And by winning, Akie and Chisato joined a rare sorority -- sisters etched into LPGA history alongside the Kordas, the Jutanugarns, and the Sorenstams.\r\n\r\nWhat will linger from this Sunday, though, isn't the data. It's the image of Akie exhaling on the 72nd green, her mother in tears nearby, the pressure of all those close calls finally lifting.\r\n\r\nAnd so, among the verdure of Portland's towering trees and fairways, Akie Iwai hoisted her first LPGA trophy, champagne-soaked and smiling. She departed Columbia Edgewater no longer the twin giving chase, but the one who had at last arrived.\r\n\r\n## Final Round Competition Highlights\r\n\r\n**Grace Kim** two back entering the day, led the field in putting despite a couple of three-putts this week; she rolled 3 key birdies on the back nine to finish in 5th with an 18 under 270\r\n\r\n**Gurleen Kaur** bounced back from a slow start yesterday, birdieing the 7th, 9th, 10th, and 17th holes, with accurate wedge shots, bringing her within a shot of the lead several times.\r\n\r\n**Chisato Iwai** already an LPGA winner; eagled multiple par fives to finish the day at a 64\r\n\r\n**Linn Grant** delivered an impressive weekend with rounds of 66-71-65-67.

We certainly hope so.\r\n\r\n**Aditi Ashok** finished strong, carding three late birdies to reach 17-under, highlighting a standout performance.\r\n\r\n**Akie Iwai** sank crucial putts down the stretch, including a long one on the 18th, to secure her win of The Standard Portland Classic and join her sister Chisato as an LPGA champion.\r\n\r\n## Shout Out\r\n\r\n**Gurleen Kaur** comes in solo second.

But Round 3 at The Standard Portland Classic proved golf isn't always that neat getting there and how little box scores capture the raw, aggressive play behind them. \r\n\r\nWe'd be remiss if we didn't start with Akie Iwai's driver off the deck on 12. She absolutely smoked it -- wide left, steep enough to look like it was hunting for kindling -- and into the towering sequoias it went. Somehow, someway, the ball bounced back into play. What followed wasn't just a save; it was a birdie. What viewed like mayhem was, in fact, a show of artistry.\r\n\r\nShe stumbled early. A single bogey at 2. That was followed by playing five holes in five under. A 5 wood to 3 feet for eagle on 5, a trio of birdies coming fast. Her pièce de résistance: a 152 yard approach to a foot on the 18th closing her round at 64 and leaving her a steady 18 under 198.\r\n\r\nIwai kept it simple when asked later: \"Rely on good tempo. No change (in approach). Aggressive. Aim to the pin.\" She capped it with a smirk and a cheeky \"Pew pew,\" sharp and focused. Marie and I spun and laughed.\r\n\r\nHot on her trail? Grace Kim. Her 17th hole provided the most important and dramatic incident after her tee shot landed in a nasty lie in the left rough by a sprinkler box. Relief? Denied. The crowd held its breath as she studied the shot, gripped her 7-iron, and ripped it anyway.\r\n\r\nIn her head and said afterwards: \"Oh, please get through the rough.\" There was a glimmer of hope as the ball landed just right of the green, kicked off the slope, and rolled in for a surreal eagle. An amazing performance sprinkled with a bit of luck.\r\n\r\nOther performances include Swede Linn Grant who stayed in contention at 14 under after a 65, saying she wasn't \"happy,\" but was embracing what the round would bring and having fun along the way. \r\n\r\nGurleen Kaur (70) and Aditi Ashok (65) are just behind, at 13 and 12 under respectively.\r\n\r\nPortland's vibe for Round 4? Sharp, fearless, and electric. Iwai's sticking to her approach, attacking pins with purpose and confidence. The story isn't done yet -- just set up, waiting for the final act.\r\n\r\n## Round 3 Competition Highlights\r\n\r\n**Cassie Porter** is having a strong rookie season, notching eight birdies and two bogeys while chasing the leaders.\r\n\r\n**Aditi Ashok** had a clean card for a 65.\r\n\r\n**Linn Grant** stayed in contention at 14 under with a 65 which included an eagle on 7\r\n\r\n**Gurleen Kaur** clawed back from a double bogey at the first, and later eagled 7 proving she can fight in contention despite first time nerves.\r\n\r\n## Shout Out\r\n\r\n**Haeran Ryu** aced the Toyota Hole-in-One 16th, banking $50,000 toward a new Toyota -- might we suggest a GR Corolla?

Gray skies hung overhead as the wind swirled the trees and swept across the ryegrass and fescue of the roughs. Still, the conditions favored those with pinpoint approach shots and steady, disciplined play.\r\n\r\nJeongeun Lee5 found her rhythm in a big way, rattling off five birdies in a row from holes 5 through 9. She has been cashing checks with her wedges through two rounds, trusting the sharp end of the bag to do the talking. She’s found 30 of 36 greens, and from that sweet spot of 100 to 125 yards, she’s been carving darts -- twelve swings averaging just 17 and a half feet from the pin! That’s more than five feet better than the tour’s norm, the kind of margin that helps explain why Korea keeps producing world-beaters and why Lee5 looks perfectly comfortable on the course. \r\n\r\nAlso making moves was Canada's Savannah Grewal, posting a 67 on the day and making her tied for 8th at -8. Thailand's Jaravee Boonchant (WR 374) stole the spotlight with seven birdies on her way to an impressive 65. \r\n\r\nGrace Kim kept herself in the hunt with some clutch up-and-downs, including a delicate chip from the water's edge on 10 and a textbook bunker escape on 14. Through two rounds she also carried not a simple stick of steel, but a precision putter, the ball chasing her will across the greens. More than a hundred feet of putts have fallen for her each day, and nine times the ball has traveled ten feet or more to the hole. That momentum carried her to -11, locking in a two-way tie for second place.

Even with limited broadcast coverage, every time you glanced away, someone else was making a move. The air had a crispness the previous days lacked, forcing players to adjust and keeping them sharp throughout the round. The tree-lined fairways delighted some, while others felt boxed in, more looking down a narrow bowling lane. The greens rolled true and fast, a solid 12 on the stimp according to some.\r\n\r\nBrooke Henderson set the tone with a four-birdie streak right out of the gate. Wichanee Meechai fired off a birdie-eagle-birdie start that had the gallery whispering and the crows cawing. Chisato Iwai, blending in with her Oregon green top, finished at three under, highlighted by an impressive eagle on the 463-yard par-5 seventh.\r\n\r\nAmerican Gurleen Kaur posted up eight birdies, while China's Miranda Wang navigated around the towering trees to card a bogey-free round, saving par eleven times. Abacaya Yubol kept her card clean with twelve pars and no bogeys, finishing the day tied for fourth alongside Haeran Ryu. Jin Young Ko of South Korea delivered a commanding performance, carding a five-under-par round with 13 pars and five birdies.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon wave, rookie Adéla Cernousek and fellow Frenchwoman Perrine Delacour made their presence felt, finishing at 8-under and 6-under, respectively.\r\n\r\nSo, at the end of Round 1 Adéla Cernousek rests alone atop the leaderboard at 8-under. A five-way logjam at 7-under sees Henderson, Kaur, Lee5, Park, and M.

Hidden behind a bunker, the ball found the cup for her first ace of the year, sending a ripple of cheers across the gallery.\r\n\r\n**Perrine Delacour**, currently ranked 118 in the world, had a phenomenal day posting 4 birdies on the front 9 and finishing tied for 7th.\r\n\r\n**Rose Zhang**, hindered by injury and a stop-start schedule struggled early, including double bogeys on 10 and 13, never quite finding her rhythm.\r\n\r\n**Wichanee Meechai** fired off a birdie-eagle-birdie start but finished even for the day.\r\n\r\n**Lilia Vu** was working to regain the form that once took her to World No. 1. 16 pars and 1 birdie on the day to end even.\r\n\r\n**Caroline Inglis** playing on her home course came close to recreating her past heroics at the 13th, setting up a short birdie putt and finishing at 2-under.\r\n\r\n**Chisato Iwai**, blending in with her Oregon green top, finished at three under, highlighted by an impressive eagle on the 463-yard par-5 seventh.\r\n\r\n**Jin Young Ko's** ball striking was sharp all day, producing a commanding five-under round built on 13 pars and five birdies.\r\n\r\n**Lauren Coughlin** pushed her way to four-under with a strong putting performance and an aggressive approach off the tees.\r\n\r\n**Yuka Saso** carded four birdies, but double bogeys on 9 and 11 knocked her back, leaving her at 6-over for the day.\r\n\r\n**Abacaya Yubol** held a one-shot lead at one point and kept a spotless card with twelve pars and no bogeys, ending the day tied for 6th.\r\n\r\nAmerican **Gurleen Kaur** posted eight birdies.\r\n\r\n**Gigi Stoll** stumbled with a triple bogey on the 426-yard par-4 third but recovered to shoot an even-par 72 for the round.\r\n\r\n## Shout Out\r\n\r\nFilipino golf fans have reason to be excited as **Dottie Ardina** posted a superb -3 for the day.

Balls lost and found like trophies from roughs and water hazards. I keep a handful in my bag, pulling them out when I'm convinced my slice has checked out for good. Call it superstition, but those balls start feeling like more than just urethane. But now, I have a new favorite: Champ. Or Champy, as Marie and I call him, the mascot of [The Dow Championship](https://dowchampionship.com/).\r\n\r\nWhy Champy? It's not sold in fun colors and doesn't offer a short game spin that my skills barely benefit from. Well, it's garnered something else from me: admiration.\r\n\r\nJune was a scorcher for players, right? Texas bakes them in the mid-90s with a heat index over 100 degrees. Then, windburned and weary, they haul themselves up north to Michigan, where it's a refreshing 75 to 80. And what else do they get when they roll into Midland Country Club? Not just a cozy golf course and a friendly crowd—but Champy, on its first birthday, dishing out cupcakes [next to a loon](https://www.milb.com/great-lakes/ballpark/lou-e). That's just part of what makes Champy and The Dow so admirable.\r\n\r\nThere's warmth and intimacy you don't find everywhere. It's a tight-knit Midwestern golf community where Dow employees and folks from neighboring towns show up shoulder-to-shoulder to cheer on the players and sing happy birthday to a giant, fluffy golf ball. It's a team event, too—the sort that can jolt a player's season back to life when the grind starts wearing thin. You can sense how much the players love it. You catch it in the laughter, feel it buzzing in the air, and see it shining through playful team names like Biggie Smalls, the Kilted Koalas, and Born to the Islands.\r\n\r\nAnd all this aids the LPGA Tour in being more than a series of tournaments that showcases top-tier talent--it attracts new fans by mixing competition with that genuine community spirit. It is helping the game grow beyond the usual circles, bringing fresh eyes and enthusiasm to the sport. It makes the LPGA an even more powerful platform for promoting women's golf worldwide.\r\n\r\nIt's also where sponsorships make a real difference. Partnerships like Dow's don't just keep the tournament running; they fuel the visibility and opportunities female athletes need to thrive. In a world where women's sports still fight for equal airtime and funding, these sponsorships help bridge the gap, allowing players to chase their dreams and providing a venue for fans to watch.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of admiration, the tournament's ambassador, Suzann Pettersen, also embodies everything this event stands for. As a Solheim Cup captain, two-time major champion, and founder of [TeamVOXA(an athlete-first talent management group)](https://teamvoxa.com/), she's more than just a name. She's a role model who shows young girls what's possible when determination meets opportunity. Her leadership and vision help light the path for the next generation of female golfers, proving that success on and off the course goes hand in hand.\r\n\r\nSo yes, Champy might not spin like a Pro V1, but it's got heart and hustle and is the face of what's arguably one of the best weeks on the LPGA calendar. And it knows how to host the kind of party where the buzz never fades, strangers turn into friends, and the drama on the course has a rival in the fun and growth happening off it.\r\n\r\nIt’s the kind of experience that folds itself into you and reminds you why we watch, why we play, and why, no matter the ball in your bag, the soul of the game stays with you long after Champy blows out the candles."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"39:Ta4d,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Let's put it plainly: Jeeno Thitikul is the best golfer in the world right now, and she did it by finishing tied for 30th at the AIG Women's Open.\r\n\r\nWe all saw it coming. Week after week, we kept asking the same thing: is this the one? And now here we are: the 22-year-old from Bangkok back on top of the Rolex Rankings. The moment came with a +1 at Porthcawl while Nelly Korda finished at +3, ending her impressive 71-week run at number one. No spotlight needed, just steady golf and the kind of composure typically reserved for Ariya Jutanugarn.\r\n\r\nIn this age where it sometimes feels we want immediate viral moments and the kind of fuss made for streaming services, Jeeno did this her way. She methodically chipped away at the rankings. You wouldn't have known it from her face Sunday, but there was triumph in her walk -- not a swagger, but that Ariya-esque stride, crossing dunes as if untouched by scores or poorly placed backboards that can hug a green. When asked about the ranking afterward, she said, \"Sometimes, it's just about surviving the week.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the week was over, did she celebrate? Of course. Maybe with an iced coffee, hold the ice, with her friend Ronnie Yin.\r\n\r\nJeeno's numbers support all this: eight top-10 finishes, runner-up at HSBC and Evian, and a win at the Mizuho Americas Open. Beyond the colorful grips, her iron game is sharp -- leading the tour with over 77% greens in regulation and averaging 4.6 birdies per round. She's a quietly relentless force among the best this season.\r\n\r\nLet's not forget, this isn't Jeeno's first time. She was No. 1 in 2022, at just 19. That stint lasted two weeks -- roughly the same amount of time the PGA of America stays concerned with a player who punches up a historic country club's locker room. But she's back now, again without a major win. Older, calmer, and in absolutely no rush to appease anybody.

And when that major finally lands--and it will--don't expect a victory lap. Just a quiet nod, that trademark grin, and then she's off again, pin-seeking like nothing ever happened.\r\n\r\nAnd the greater truth?

She said herself she came into the AIG Women's Open thinking she wouldn't make the cut. That's not just false modesty; she [collapsed at Evian](https://www.skratch.golf/news/news/charley-hull-evian-illness-update-womens-scottish-open), suffered a back injury that limited her practice time, and still showed up at Royal Porthcawl like she'd just fought off an adder with a long iron.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, there she was on Sunday afternoon -- the crowd surging like the tide, the wind sweeping through with the rhythm of a Dylan Thomas verse, moody and irregular -- finishing runner-up in a major she supposedly had no business contending in at all.\r\n\r\nHull's round was a feast of nearly. Nearly pure. Nearly birdie. Nearly glory. But not a drop of regret on the plate. Watching the coverage, one could see her standing in the mixed zone afterward, giving the kind of interview that makes media hover nervously and a certain type of fan lean in.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't even hit a bad shot on 16,\" she said, with the conviction of someone who knows. \"I hit it so pure the wind didn't even move it an inch.\"\r\n\r\nGolfers can lie, but Hull? Hull might be the rare one telling too much truth. No fibbing about misreads or nerves. No humble bragging about grinding it out. She hit it well. The Welsh wind didn't care. The goddesses of Avalon shrugged. So she moved on.\r\n\r\nOn 17, she missed a putt she struck well. On 18, she had a high chip over a bunker that would give anyone but Grace Kim flop sweats. She got it close, didn't hole the putt, and signed for a round that any rational player would be proud of. Yet rationality and Major Sundays don't mix.\r\n\r\n\"I felt like I was in control of my game today. I don't feel like I mis-hit any shots. I hit it pretty pure.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, the shrug. Not literal, she's professional and too composed for that, but the verbal equivalent came later, wrapped in adrenaline and her dry delivery:\r\n\r\n\"At the end of the day, it's just a game.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, that's a lie, too. But a necessary one. Because this *just a game* nearly turned into *her game*. She got within one shot twice and didn't know it because she never looked at a leaderboard.\r\n\r\n\"Was I even in the lead?\"\r\n\r\nHad she asked any louder, someone might've howled the scores from the ropes. But Hull's never been one to need numbers to trust her instincts. She plays like someone raised on turf, who learned to spin wedges by feel, and prefers her caddie point out the hole locations like he's holding a map drawn in pencil. Visualizing links shots, she admits, is not her thing. She prefers targets. Trees. Something there.\r\n\r\nSo of course, she found herself in contention beside Rest Bay, her deeds anything but frail in a place where the target is often \"that ragged tuft beyond the dune\" or \"one bounce shy of the gorse bush left of the TV tower.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't really like links,\" she said in May. She doubled down on that post-round. \"It doesn't suit me. I find it hard to visualize shots.\"\r\n\r\nWatching Hull is like watching someone play poker while forgetting the rules halfway through and still walks off with a straight flush. Her strategy is unconventional, her swing aggressive in the way tavern arguments are aggressive, and her commentary refreshingly unfiltered.\r\n\r\nShe's also, by her own admission, \"kind of insane sometimes.\" But maybe you have to be? Chasing a major, riding the crowd, three collapses behind you, and the cut line forgotten.\r\n\r\n\"I hit wayward shots,\" she said. \"But I can get up-and-down and stuff.\"\r\n\r\nThat's not just a quote. That's a philosophy. Embroider it on your jumper.\r\n\r\nCharley Hull won't be satisfied with another second place, and neither should you. And if you're looking for a true soul of women's golf, the kind that will not go gentle into that good night (or press tent), she's out there plumbobing her putter: a little chipped, a little cheeky, and unmistakably alive."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1e:[\"$\",\"$L21\",null,{\"articles\":[{\"id\":\"queen-city-round-4-2025\",\"slug\":\"queen-city-round-4-2025\",\"title\":\"Queen of the City: Charley Hull Wins in Cincinnati\",\"author\":\"George Hack\",\"authorId\":\"george-hack\",\"date\":\"2025-09-15\",\"category\":\"Tournament Golf\",\"excerpt\":\"After a season of near misses and injuries, Charley Hull finally broke through at TPC River's Bend.
