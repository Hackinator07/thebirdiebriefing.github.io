25:Tdbf,Thursday's opening round of the FM Championship delivered birdies, sharp iron play, and putting that made the greens at TPC Boston feel alive. Four players, and a rookie or two, had distinctive approaches to the course and the leaderboard.

Korea's Sei Young Kim laid the groundwork, opening with a bogey-free 65. Her precision off the tee and approach shots left little room for error--she missed just two greens all day and hit eight approaches inside 20 feet. From 75–125 yards, her shots averaged just over 10 feet from the hole. Two birdies in the first four holes carried her through the round. "All the birdies make me relax and have confidence," she said. "Momentum's everything." Still, the elusive victory continues to slip through her fingers; Kim has 21 top-10s since 2021 but no win.

Allisen Corpuz matched Kim's 65 to make a statement. From 150–175 yards, she averaged 23 feet to the hole and closed strong with birdies on 15, 16, and 17. "I had a lot of looks and was able to convert," Corpuz said.

American Andrea Lee quietly kept pace with a bogey-free 67 of her own, continuing a run that has her ranked fifth on the LPGA Tour in strokes gained since May and 27 in the world ranking. Balanced iron play and solid putting kept her in contention, underscoring the value of consistency on a course like TPC Boston.

A putter is a confidence machine, and even Nelly Korda isn't immune to its quirks. After losing her No. 1 ranking, she shelved the trusty Spider Tour X and slotted a TaylorMade Del Monte blade with adjustable weights into the bag--a little twist, a little gamble, and a whole lot of "let's see what happens." Well, the swap worked: seven birdies and a 5-under 67. An early bogey at the 4th and another at the 10th didn't faze her. "Just something new… different grip, different feel—I went with it," Korda said. Perhaps it’ll prove rewarding—her streak of made cuts remains unbroken, though that first win of the season still eludes her.

Jodi Ewart Shadoff made moves, birdying the final four holes of her round to join Kim and Corpuz atop the leaderboard at 7-under. Rookie Miranda Wang added flavor to the mix, finishing solo fourth at 6-under after eight birdies on the front nine.

By the close of play, TPC Boston had made its message clear: sharp iron play and confident putting were the keys to a low score. The leaders, having scoped the greens hole by hole, head into Round 2 with a strategy in place. More birdies, a handful of eagles, and a cutline around -1 are likely. It'll be tight, and with ESPN+ feature coverage, every shot will carry a little extra weight.

## Round 1 Competition Highlights

**Sei Young Kim** opens with bogey-free 65 with eight approaches inside 20 feet.

**Allisen Corpuz** matches 65, finishes hot with birdies on 15–17.

**Minjee Lee** with 209 feet of putts, including a 55-foot.

**Andrea Lee** posts 67, showcasing steady, balanced play.

**Nelly Korda** finds some rhythm with her putter shooting 5-under 67.

**Jodi Ewart Shadoff** birdies final four holes to share 7-under lead.

**Wei Wei Zhang** bounces back from recent missed cut, finishing 5-under with an eagle on hole 2.

## Shout Out

We need to praise **Miranda Wang** for an incredible opening round—66 with nine birdies! Simply amazing.

**Frida Kinhult, Mi-Hyang Lee, and Ingrid Lindblad** for dialing in eagles on the 18th hole.

## Gear Notes

**Nelly Korda** using a TaylorMade Del Monte putter with a SuperStroke grip.26:Tc24,The LPGA’s top golfers tee off this week at the 2025 FM Championship, running August 28-31 at TPC Boston. With a $4.1 million prize purse, the event ranks among the biggest on the LPGA Tour outside of the major championships.

**The Venue**

TPC Boston is a New England venue shaped with design elements reminiscent of golf’s old-country heritage.  Arnold Palmer laid down the original plan in 2003, but four years later [Gil Hanse]( https://www.hansegolfdesign.com/) and PGA Tour player [Brad Faxon]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Faxon) were called in to rough it up. Their job was to make the course feel less like a set of lines on paper and more like a stretch of New England countryside you might wander across. They succeeded.

Don’t let the pastoral charm fool you. TPC Boston has its tests, and they show most clearly at the 18th. Nicknamed the “Hell Hole,” it plays 504 yards for the tournament with "birdie" written on the scorecard, but it can easily wreck a round. Trouble lurks everywhere: bunkers right, slopes that reject even well-struck wedges. The hole has humbled more players than it has rewarded. Reach the green in one piece, and a par feels like a small victory; a birdie, a cause for celebration. [Haeran Ryu herself birdied 18 in 2024]( https://youtu.be/S7k6bxwnpC0?t=346) to win in a playoff against Jin Young Ko.

**LPGA’s Elite Players Tee Off Again**

Thirty-six of the top 40 players in the Rolex Women’s World Golf Rankings are here, led by No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul and No. 2 Nelly Korda. There are 70 LPGA Tour winners in the mix, including defending champ Haeran Ryu and last year’s runner-up, Jin Young Ko. Every single one of the 2025 major champions will be swinging, and 21 of this year’s 23 LPGA Tour winners are on hand.

Local fans have some familiar faces to cheer for: Massachusetts natives Megan Khang (Rockland), Brittany Altomare (Shrewsbury), and Alexa Pano (Westborough) will all be in the mix. Add two top amateurs--Megha Ganne and Amelie Zalsman--, and you’ve got a field that’s part global powerhouse, part hometown story.

A final round that felt less like stroke play and more like match play, where every birdie and every answer from Minjee Lee hung heavy in the air. By the time Henderson rolled in her final putt and lifted the trophy, the Canadian galleries had their dream ending -- their star back on top, on home soil, for the first time in more than two years.

Henderson's closing 4-under 67 at Mississaugua pushed her to 15 under, one shot clear of Lee's 68. The win marked her second CPKC Women's Open title, her 14th career victory on the LPGA Tour, and an emphatic end to a drought that had stretched across 64 starts.

"This week was beyond special," Henderson said, standing behind the 18th green. "To be able to win my national open again, in front of these crowds… it feels surreal."

**A Sunday Match Play**

The day began with Henderson and Lee tied at 11 under, three clear of the field. The crowd sensed it early: this was no longer a four-day tournament but a head-to-head contest between Canada's brightest star and one of the game's most polished champions.

The momentum swung like a pendulum. At the par-5 13th, Henderson nearly eagled but settled for birdie. Lee answered, rolling in her own. On the very next hole, the pivotal par-3 14th, Henderson made a pure 6-foot birdie putt for a one-stroke lead.

Then came a behind the netter. On the 17th, with the gallery encircling the short par-4, Lee drained a 13-footer for birdie. The roar barely settled before Henderson stepped up and buried her own from 12 feet. Birdie for birdie.

Lee smiled. Henderson clenched her fist. The match ever so tilted Henderson's way. She carried that one-stroke edge to the house.

"I kind of got outplayed," Lee admitted, gracious in defeat. "I did my job. But Brooke was just a little better today."

**A Career Marker**

For Henderson, 27, the victory carries more weight than just number 14 on her career tally. This was her first title since the Diamond Resorts Tournament of Champions in January 2023, and it arrived after months of doubt, struggle, and slipping down the world rankings.

She is projected to leap back into the top 30 in the Race to CME Globe, securing her spot in the season-ending CME Group Tour Championship. More importantly, she reminded herself -- and everyone else -- what a locked-in Brooke Henderson looks like.

When she first won this championship in 2018 at Wascana, she became the first Canadian in 45 years to lift the national title. To do it again, seven years later, in front of her home fans felt like the circle closing once more.

"I thought I might cry, honestly," Henderson said. "It's just been so long. I felt like this week was meant to be."

To our Canadian friends across the Great Lakes, to the thunderous galleries, to those filling sports bars from coast to coast, and to the entire Canadian golf community -- bravo for the way you carried Henderson. Even her peers seemed to understand the weight of the moment. She had fought through doubts and close calls, only to find her game again when the stage demanded it. And so, a Canadian classic was written.

## Round 4 Competition Highlights

**Henderson's** birdie on 14 gave her the solo lead — and she never gave it back.

**Minjee Lee** holed a birdie from 13 feet only for Henderson to answer immediately with her own from 12.

**The galleries around Henderson were massive**, the kind of Canadian following that was Ryder Cup-sized at times.

**Henderson's** up-and-downs on 15 and 16 held her lead steady in the tightest stretch of the round.

Fifteen-year-old phenom **Aphrodite Deng** tied for 20th at 4 under, capping a remarkable week.

**Mao Saigo** finished third at 11 under.

**Akie Iwai**, who led after two rounds, settled for fourth.

## Shout Out

**Canada's** steadfast support for its sports stars was nothing short of inspiring.

## Gear Notes

Henderson sealed the win playing a TaylorMade TP5x golf ball.28:T1558,Henderson lit up the third round with a 6-under 65, capped by the kind of closing stretch that can tilt a tournament and change the mood of an entire gallery. She birdied the 15th and 16th, holed out from the greenside bunker on the short par-4 17th to ignite the crowd, and finished with a par on 18. Her father and longtime coach, Dave Henderson, even broke his usual stoicism with a rare celebration, pumping his arms as if even he couldn't hold back the noise. The finish pushed her to 11-under and tied with Minjee Lee for the lead.

The bunker shot on 17 was the day's defining moment, a piece of theater. Mississaugua's par-4 seventeenth doesn't look like much on the card, but standing on it in the heat of battle is something different. A big drive leaves only a wedge, and Henderson's left her approach in the front bunker, a tricky lie staring her down with the tournament hanging in the air. What came next was the kind of shot you remember years later: the crisp strike, the thump of sand, and the ball climbing out of the lip before landing soft and tracking straight into the hole. The roar sounded less like a golf clap and more like an arena crowd. Henderson called her round an "A" and admitted she was actually happy to see the ball end up in the sand, knowing she had the chance to pull something off.

She hasn't won since January 2023 or posted a top-10 this season, but her record is daunting: eight victories in her last 11 tries when holding at least a share of the lead heading into Sunday. History may not repeat, but it often rhymes, and Henderson has the kind of winning muscle memory that can carry her across a finish line.

Lee nearly matched Henderson with a 66, a round just as brilliant but built differently-- the kind of steady method she's made a career on. Two eagles, a birdie chip-in, and a deft par save at 18 filled her card. The Australian, who won the KPMG Women's PGA Championship in June, is chasing her 12th LPGA title and her second of the year. Her career has never been about flash, though the numbers say she belongs among the elite: two majors, a slew of wins across three continents, and a knack for playing her best when the courses demand discipline. After years of frustration with the putter, she's turned the switch to the long model into one of the season's most dangerous weapons. When the stroke is rolling, she doesn't just score; she squeezes the air out of the leaderboard.

Three shots back, world No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul sits tied for third with Japan's Akie Iwai. Thitikul's steady 69 kept her in the mix, a quiet round that looked routine on the card but was anything but simple on a course where thick rough and uneven lies lurk at every corner. She carries herself like someone twice her age -- patient, precise, and never hurried -- which makes sense for a player who has spent most of her teenage years ranked inside the world's top five. Iwai, meanwhile, struggled early with 3 bogeys to start her round but steadied herself, and her firepower is the kind that can heat up quickly. Both players loom as serious Sunday dangers.

Canadian amateur Aphrodite Deng shot 68 to reach 6-under, tied for seventh. She needed only 26 putts and continues to showcase a lethal wedge game. A top-12 finish would mark the best LPGA result by an amateur this season, adding another layer of intrigue to an already Canadian-heavy storyline. It isn't just Henderson carrying The Maple Leaf.

For Henderson, the opportunity is singular. A 13-time winner, she's looking to become the first Canadian to win her national open twice since 1914. Winning again, on home soil, would put her in rarefied company and cement her as the most accomplished Canadian player of any era.

The galleries will be hers on Sunday, and she knows it. "Winning in 2018 was a huge career highlight," she said. "To be in this position again is really, really cool. I just hope to get a fast start, make birdies, and get the crowd on my side."

The CPKC Women's Open has grown into something larger than a golf tournament. It carries identity, memory, and emotion—for the fans who fill the ropes as much as for the players inside them. Henderson and Lee have staged a duel worthy of the spotlight, with world No. 1 Thitikul and a fearless amateur close enough to change the script. Whether it finishes in maple-leaf triumph or an Australian claim, Mississaugua is set to deliver a champion in major fashion.

## Round 3 Competition Highlights

**Brooke Henderson** shot 6-under 65, including a holed bunker shot for eagle on 17.

**Minjee Lee** carded a 66 with two eagles (12 and 17) and a par-saving chip-in at 18.

**Jeeno Thitikul** three shots back at 8-under after a steady 69. She recorded five birdies.

**Akie Iwai** dropped to a 72 on Saturday but tied for third at 8-under.

**Aphrodite Deng** needed just 26 putts, converting nearly every look inside 15 feet.

**Leona Maguire** nearly aced the par-3 6th hole.

**Yu Liu** shot a 67 on Saturday to climb into contention at 7-under.

**Pajaree Anannarukarn** is not in contention but leads the Audi Precision Award with 43 greens in regulation.

## Gear Notes

[TaylorMade Qi35 Driver](https://www.taylormadegolf.com/Qi35-Driver/DW-TC370.html?lang=en_US).29:Tea8,At Mississaugua, round two delivered shifts, scares, and cheers as players fought for weekend ground. Mississaugua’s first crack at hosting the CPKC Women’s Open showed off quick greens, heavy rough, and a layout built that demanded patience while keeping eagles and birdies hard-earned.

Akie Iwai, fresh off her breakthrough in Portland, continued her strong play and aggressive style. It occasionally cost her. Even so, she closed the day with a steady 2-under 69 to build a three-shot cushion at 9-under, though afterward she admitted to leaving too many birdie chances on the table.

Leona Maguire, one of the most consistent drivers on tour, delivered several long-range putts to stay in contention despite battling with the flatstick at shorter range. Australia’s Minjee Lee and world No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul joined Maguire in the chasing pack at 6-under.

And then there was Brooke Henderson. Even the winningest golfer in Canadian history can still look like she’s cramming for the exam, and Friday was a case study. Henderson, cheered on by the largest gallery of the day, turned in a 5-under 66 that vaulted her 33 spots up the board and away from the cut line that had been uncomfortably close. “I just wanted to get away from the cut line as fast as I could,” she said afterward, and did so with the casual urgency of someone checking their rearview mirror, then stomping on the gas. Any time Henderson’s name creeps near the top of the board on Canadian soil, the energy follows—loud, expectant, and full of possibility.

Stacy Lewis showed her veteran poise with a clever recovery from a penalty area to save par, while Sweden’s Linnea Ström nearly jarred an approach at 17. Young Canadian amateur Aphrodite Deng and Québec’s Maude-Aimée Leblanc brought local flavor to the pairings. Fifteen-year-old Deng cooled off after her electric opening round but still held her ground at 3-under, another reminder that the country's future talent isn't stuck on the bench or skating the second line anymore; she's already teeing it up under the spotlight.

For the weekend, the greens are smooth enough to make a Zamboni driver smile. Iwai holds the lead, Henderson is charging, and the leaderboard is the kind of Saturday puzzle that makes a national championship worth following. With narrow margins, a raucous crowd, veterans holding steady, and young guns pressing, the CPKC Women’s Open heads into the final 36 holes wide open and ready for a thrilling finish.

## Round 2 Competition Highlights

**Akie Iwai** shot a 2-under 69 to take a three-stroke lead at 9-under par.

Canadian fan favorite **Brooke Henderson** made a massive leap up the leaderboard with a 5-under 66, moving 33 spots away from the cut line.

**Maude-Aimée Leblanc**, the Quebec native, who has battled injuries, made a clutch putt, demonstrating the progress she's made.

**Leona Maguire, Minjee Lee, and Jeeno Thitikul** are all tied for second at 6-under, setting up a thrilling final 36 holes.

**Stacy Lewis** saved par with a crafty shot from a penalty area, earning one of the loudest applauses of the day.

**Linnea Ström** nearly holed out at 17, showcasing sharp iron play.

**Yan Liu** posted a four-under round with excellent pace on the greens, moving up the leaderboard.

## Shout Out

## Gear Notes

**Brooke Henderson’s driver** is so hot it might set off the sprinklers.2a:T1308,The first round of the CPKC Women's Open gave us a leaderboard that was equal parts expected and surprising. Familiar champions like Jin Young Ko and Nelly Korda went searching for form, Akie Iwai posted a flawless 64 to take the solo lead, and a 15-year-old Canadian amateur with an unshakable stare stole much of the spotlight.

Jin Young Ko--once unstoppable, now two years removed from her last win looked steady, carding 5 birdies, including the par 5s of 12 and 13. Showing the pinpoint iron play that earned her the world No. 1 spot in 2020, this is the same player who went bogey-free over 72 holes to claim this event in 2019--and she’s signaling she could do it again.

Nelly Korda, meanwhile, is still chasing her first victory of 2025 after piling up seven a year ago. Her round was a blend of sharp birdies and a rare stumble at the 175-yard par-3 third. Still, she exhibited the brilliance that makes her game so unmistakable--none better than a wedge from 81 yards that back-spun into easy scoring range. The mudball she faced at 11, the toughest hole of the day, was the kind of bad break that can throw off rhythm, but she salvaged enough to save par.

And then there's sponsor invitee Aphrodite Deng, the Canadian amateur who plays like she's seen this stage before. Just 15 years old and already a U.S. Girls' Junior champion, she led stretches of the day with poise beyond her years. She hit nearly every fairway, stuck approaches close, and even when she missed, her recovery shots carried quiet confidence. Whether it's adrenaline or just youth, Deng hasn't blinked. Six birdies and a first-round 66 have her sitting T2, making her Canadian debut a national storyline.

Megan Kang, 2023's CPKC winner in Vancouver, kept herself firmly in the mix with three birdies in four holes. Kang knows this golf course, knows the pressure, and still makes it look routine. Her controlled fades off the tee and steady putting kept her close to the leader.

Other names surfaced and impressed: Gaby Lopez, showing graceful touch, finished her round tied for second with 7 birdies; rookie Ina Yoon grinding out pars from thick Canadian rough; and Taiwan's Chien Peiyun carded a 68 thanks to her crisp ball striking.

The greens rolled pure--"smooth," one player said--rewarding aggressive iron play but punishing hesitation. Several players noted switching to firmer wedges this week to handle the tight and muddy fringes. Together, the field and Mississaugua produced exactly the kind of test you'd expect from an LPGA stage of this caliber.

## Round 1 Competition Highlights

**Jin Young Ko's** birdie run included a sharp seven-iron at 16 to set up her fourth birdie of the day, showing flashes of her 2019 Ontario form.

**Gaby Lopez** recorded six birdies in her final 10 holes, tying for the most birdies in the field on Thursday with seven.

**Nelly Korda** recovered from a shaky approach on 11 with a perfectly flighted 81-yard wedge at 12 that spun to four feet, keeping her in contention.

**Jeeno Thitikul** also at T2, shot six birdies over her last 10 holes, including back-to-back birdies on Nos. 3-4 and 9-10. It was her first start at the CPKC Women's Open since moving to Rolex No. 1.

**Aphrodite Deng**, the 15-year-old amateur, hit nearly every fairway and dropped just one bogey, holding her ground against seasoned winners and ended R1 as the lowest Canadian in the field.

**Megan Kang**, last year's champion, climbed the board with a burst of birdies on the back nine, demonstrating comfort and poise at Mississaugua.

**Soo Bin Joo** sits 7th at four under, citing improvements in mental game, swing, putting, and chipping for her solid round.

**Leona Maguire** sits T2 after a 66, posting six birdies against one bogey. She missed just one fairway, birdied it, and praised the smooth greens for giving herself plenty of scoring opportunities.

**Yuna Nishimura** electrified the gallery with a long birdie putt that rolled true, a reminder of her fearless putting stroke.

**Hae Ran Ryu** displayed precise iron play with aggressive wedge shots into tucked pins, earning multiple birdies.

**Lindy Duncan** clanged her approach off the flagstick at 16, striking the cup so sharply it dented the metal.

## Shout Out

Puppy pets to Blue, the German Shepherd-Malinois mix from the [Halton Regional Police Service](https://www.haltonpolice.ca/en/index.aspx), for holding down duties as the official course dog.

Hats off to the [local cormorant](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Double-crested_Cormorant/overview) feasting on Credit River catfish. Thanks for sharing a little slice of wild beauty while we watched the action.

## Gear Notes

Nothing too major to note. A few players opted for stiffer-shafted wedges to better handle the thick, muddy fringes and rough around the course.2b:T17d0,The 51st CPKC Women's Open doesn't just look like a major, it feels like it. The field would pass for one in any corner of the golf world. 156 players are here, six of them sitting in the Rolex top 10, and every one chasing a slice of $2.75 million and the chance to carve their name on the open trophy.

**The Venue**

This year's Canadian Open takes place on the fairways of Mississaugua Golf & Country Club, a course that carries real gravitas. The Credit River winds through its valley, shaping a landscape at once pastoral and formidable. The greens and bunkers, refined by Donald Ross, still bear the original mark of George Cumming's design. And as the spotlight shines, Canada is poised to put its finest golf and hospitality on display for us. 

It is important to recognize that this course stands on the traditional lands of the [Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation](https://mncfn.ca/), whose history and connection to this traditional territory carries significance greater than the game played upon it.

**The Past in Play**

For some in the field, Mississaugua is not entirely new ground. In 2016, the club hosted the World Junior Girls Championship, where Yuka Saso hoisted the individual trophy while leading the Philippines to a team win. She's back now as a two-time U.S. Women's Open champion, looking to rediscover the magic of those fairways. Alongside her are Haeran Ryu, Maja Stark, and Esther Henseleit -- players who also walked these grounds in that juniors championship and now return as proven winners.

**Maple Leaf Standouts**

Brooke Henderson, the face of Canadian golf and a 13-time LPGA Tour winner, is in the field and hot off a T23 finish in Portland. Henderson's 2018 triumph at this championship remains one of the defining moments in Canadian sport, ending a 45-year drought and being the first national win since Jocelyne Bourassa in 1973. She leads a group of Canadians in the field, each chasing that same dream of lifting their country's championship trophy on home soil (maybe sneaking in a few celebratory Tim Hortons Timbiebs for good measure).

**The World's Best Are Back**

[Newly crowned No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul](https://www.birdiebriefing.com/news/jeeno-thitikul-quiet-stride/) makes her first start since climbing past Nelly Korda in the rankings. Korda, meanwhile, is still searching for her first win of 2025 despite a season full of close calls. Lydia Ko, a three-time winner of the Canadian Open, returns with the kind of experience that makes her dangerous. And rising star Lottie Woad, riding wins in Ireland and Scotland, adds another layer of intrigue to an already loaded entry list.

**Coughlin Returns**

[At Earl Grey Golf Club](https://earlgreygolfclub.com/) in Calgary last year, Lauren Coughlin finally cracked through with her first LPGA victory at this very event. That win ignited a streak that carried her to a second title at Dundonald and a victorious debut in the Solheim Cup. Now, back in Canada to defend, she brings momentum with her, a T7 finish last week in Portland.

**Sponsor Invitees**

The championship has also welcomed sponsor invites that ensure the next wave has its chance to shine. Ontario's Alena Sharp and Quebec's Maude-Aimée Leblanc are in the field, joined by rising amateurs like Anna Davis, Carla Bernat Escuder, and U.S. Women's Amateur champion Megha Ganne.

**Sustainable Approach**

Golf Canada is raising the bar on sustainability at the Open, aiming to make the tournament zero-waste and carbon-neutral. Partnering with the Green Event Ninjas, the event has already diverted 75% of waste, recycled thousands of kilograms of material, and eliminated nearly 68,000 single-use water bottles. With fans encouraged to bike, carpool, and engage in eco-friendly practices, the Open is setting a new standard for environmental responsibility.

Anyone who's played the restored Kenosha or another Ross course knows how effortlessly his designs merge with the natural terrain.*2c:Tf83,Akie Iwai's first win had been circling all season, tapping her shoulder in Thailand, wagging its finger in Los Angeles. Then she watched her twin sister, Chisato, sip champagne in Mexico while she smiled through the twinge of being the other half of the story. On Sunday in Portland, she finally got to write her own ending.

The 23-year-old rookie from Saitama closed with a bogey-free 66 to win The Standard Portland Classic by four, finishing at 24-under. Six birdies and no errors -- the kind of round players dream about but rarely manage when it matters most. She birdied Nos. 5 and 6 to settle herself, then went about the back nine like a painter, deliberate and precise in her strokes. She sealed the victory with birdies on 17 and 18, the last an 18-footer that rolled in with the composure of a player who had already made up her mind about the outcome.

That's when sister Chisato came running across the green, champagne bottle in hand. If the LPGA is still searching for its next great sibling storyline, it found it in that moment -- a younger sister by sixty seconds dousing her twin in fizzy, French affirmation.

The rest of the field deserves their ink. American Gurleen Kaur posted her career-best finish, runner-up at 20-under, and appeared like a player eager to keep going if only there had been a fifth round to play. Linn Grant shared third with Chisato, and Grace Kim stayed in the conversation at 18-under. Even Oregon amateur Kiara Romero made noise with a 64 and a tie for seventh, giving the local Ducks faithful a glimpse of the future. But in truth, the week belonged to Akie.

Her win folds neatly into a larger Japanese surge on tour this year. She became the fifth from her country to win in 2025, joining Chisato, Rio Takeda, Mao Saigo, and British Open champion Miyu Yamashita. It feels less like coincidence and more like a movement, each name sharpening the edge of Japanese golf. And by winning, Akie and Chisato joined a rare sorority -- sisters etched into LPGA history alongside the Kordas, the Jutanugarns, and the Sorenstams.

What will linger from this Sunday, though, isn't the data. It's the image of Akie exhaling on the 72nd green, her mother in tears nearby, the pressure of all those close calls finally lifting.

And so, among the verdure of Portland's towering trees and fairways, Akie Iwai hoisted her first LPGA trophy, champagne-soaked and smiling. She departed Columbia Edgewater no longer the twin giving chase, but the one who had at last arrived.

## Final Round Competition Highlights

**Grace Kim** two back entering the day, led the field in putting despite a couple of three-putts this week; she rolled 3 key birdies on the back nine to finish in 5th with an 18 under 270

**Gurleen Kaur** bounced back from a slow start yesterday, birdieing the 7th, 9th, 10th, and 17th holes, with accurate wedge shots, bringing her within a shot of the lead several times.

**Chisato Iwai** already an LPGA winner; eagled multiple par fives to finish the day at a 64

**Linn Grant** delivered an impressive weekend with rounds of 66-71-65-67. Could she be next to capture a tournament victory? We certainly hope so.

**Aditi Ashok** finished strong, carding three late birdies to reach 17-under, highlighting a standout performance.

**Akie Iwai** sank crucial putts down the stretch, including a long one on the 18th, to secure her win of The Standard Portland Classic and join her sister Chisato as an LPGA champion.

## Shout Out

**Gurleen Kaur** comes in solo second. Exactly the kind of golf we want to see more of!

## Gear Notes

**Akie Iwai** captured The Standard Portland Classic [gaming the Z-STAR XV](https://us.dunlopsports.com/srixon/steady-dominance-products/z-star-xv-golf-balls/10360119.html), putting the ball back in the winner's circle. Srixon has had a dominant 2025 season, collecting three majors at the Chevron Championship, Amundi Evian, and AIG Women's Open.2d:Tc70,If Akie Iwai hangs on, it'll be a tidy LPGA rookie story: first win, big smile, trophy hoisted. But Round 3 at The Standard Portland Classic proved golf isn't always that neat getting there and how little box scores capture the raw, aggressive play behind them. 

We'd be remiss if we didn't start with Akie Iwai's driver off the deck on 12. She absolutely smoked it -- wide left, steep enough to look like it was hunting for kindling -- and into the towering sequoias it went. Somehow, someway, the ball bounced back into play. What followed wasn't just a save; it was a birdie. What viewed like mayhem was, in fact, a show of artistry.

She stumbled early. A single bogey at 2. That was followed by playing five holes in five under. A 5 wood to 3 feet for eagle on 5, a trio of birdies coming fast. Her pièce de résistance: a 152 yard approach to a foot on the 18th closing her round at 64 and leaving her a steady 18 under 198.

Iwai kept it simple when asked later: "Rely on good tempo. No change (in approach). Aggressive. Aim to the pin." She capped it with a smirk and a cheeky "Pew pew," sharp and focused. Marie and I spun and laughed.

Hot on her trail? Grace Kim. Her 17th hole provided the most important and dramatic incident after her tee shot landed in a nasty lie in the left rough by a sprinkler box. Relief? Denied. The crowd held its breath as she studied the shot, gripped her 7-iron, and ripped it anyway.

In her head and said afterwards: "Oh, please get through the rough." There was a glimmer of hope as the ball landed just right of the green, kicked off the slope, and rolled in for a surreal eagle. An amazing performance sprinkled with a bit of luck.

Other performances include Swede Linn Grant who stayed in contention at 14 under after a 65, saying she wasn't "happy," but was embracing what the round would bring and having fun along the way. 

Gurleen Kaur (70) and Aditi Ashok (65) are just behind, at 13 and 12 under respectively.

Portland's vibe for Round 4? Sharp, fearless, and electric. Iwai's sticking to her approach, attacking pins with purpose and confidence. The story isn't done yet -- just set up, waiting for the final act.

## Round 3 Competition Highlights

**Cassie Porter** is having a strong rookie season, notching eight birdies and two bogeys while chasing the leaders.

**Aditi Ashok** had a clean card for a 65.

**Linn Grant** stayed in contention at 14 under with a 65 which included an eagle on 7

**Gurleen Kaur** clawed back from a double bogey at the first, and later eagled 7 proving she can fight in contention despite first time nerves.

## Shout Out

**Haeran Ryu** aced the Toyota Hole-in-One 16th, banking $50,000 toward a new Toyota -- might we suggest a GR Corolla? Worth noting, that's $80,000 shy of what the men are offered at the BMW Championship.

Gray skies hung overhead as the wind swirled the trees and swept across the ryegrass and fescue of the roughs. Still, the conditions favored those with pinpoint approach shots and steady, disciplined play.

Jeongeun Lee5 found her rhythm in a big way, rattling off five birdies in a row from holes 5 through 9. She has been cashing checks with her wedges through two rounds, trusting the sharp end of the bag to do the talking. She’s found 30 of 36 greens, and from that sweet spot of 100 to 125 yards, she’s been carving darts -- twelve swings averaging just 17 and a half feet from the pin! That’s more than five feet better than the tour’s norm, the kind of margin that helps explain why Korea keeps producing world-beaters and why Lee5 looks perfectly comfortable on the course. 

Also making moves was Canada's Savannah Grewal, posting a 67 on the day and making her tied for 8th at -8. Thailand's Jaravee Boonchant (WR 374) stole the spotlight with seven birdies on her way to an impressive 65. 

Grace Kim kept herself in the hunt with some clutch up-and-downs, including a delicate chip from the water's edge on 10 and a textbook bunker escape on 14. Through two rounds she also carried not a simple stick of steel, but a precision putter, the ball chasing her will across the greens. More than a hundred feet of putts have fallen for her each day, and nine times the ball has traveled ten feet or more to the hole. That momentum carried her to -11, locking in a two-way tie for second place. And now, thanks to a 7-under bet, her physical therapist is officially donning a yellow tutu at the [International Crown](https://crown.lpga.com/) -- with any luck [Skippy will be in tow](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMERtb5Npqq/) for good measure!

As Round 2 concludes, Jeongeun Lee5 holds solo first, with Gurleen Kaur and Grace Kim tied for second. A three-way tie for third includes Pajaree Anannarukarn, Ashleigh Buhai, and Akie Iwai, while Aline Krauter, Amelia Lewis, Yealimi Noh, and Miranda Wang share fourth place.

## Round 2 Competition Highlights

**Jeongeun Lee5** surged to the top with a blistering stretch of five straight birdies, reaching 12-under and leading by two shots at one stage. She followed her hot streak with a key par save at the par-5 10th.

**Gurleen Kaur** posted 12 pars and birdies for a 68, tying her with Grace Kim for second place.  

**Stacy Lewis** recovered from a short missed birdie on 10 with birdies at 12, 14, and 16 displaying some excellent putting tempo.

**Linn Grant** had a streaky day, making important par saves but struggling at times with the putter including a bogey on 12.

**Gigi Stoll**, a hometown player from Oregon, had family following and nearly holed a chip early in her round, ultimately finishing the day with a 70.

**Amelia Lewis (179th CME)** battled to make the most of her limited LPGA status, executing a key bunker save under pressure.

**Gabby Ruffels** played with her brother Ryan on the bag, delivering a strong approach into 18 in her bid to contend.

**Rose Zhang and Xiaowen Yin** are tied for 27th after matching rounds of 64, with Zhang making a standout eagle on the par-4 ninth.

**Julia Lopez Ramirez** turned in a masterclass in par saves, carding 16 of them on the day.

## Shout Out

**Juli Inkster**, affectionately dubbed the "least youthful" player in the field by cherished commentator Grant Boone, closed the day at +2 and sits at -1 overall. -- not enough to make the cut and stay in contention for the win but Juli, we love you. Absolute boss aura.

**Kiara Romero (Amat)**, the Oregon Duck and world No. 766, eagled the par-5 12th and closed the day at 8-under, tied for sixth. Eyes on you, go get it.

**Aditi Ashok** marked India's Independence Day with precise approach shots to the center of the greens, opting for a steady, conservative strategy.

## Gear Notes

**Ashley Buhai** switched to a new putter after her South Africa coaching session, rolling in five birdies to finish 4-under.2f:T1119,Columbia Edgewater opened cool and calm on day one, with barely a hint of wind – perfect conditions for what felt like a spring-loaded leaderboard. Even with limited broadcast coverage, every time you glanced away, someone else was making a move. The air had a crispness the previous days lacked, forcing players to adjust and keeping them sharp throughout the round. The tree-lined fairways delighted some, while others felt boxed in, more looking down a narrow bowling lane. The greens rolled true and fast, a solid 12 on the stimp according to some.

Brooke Henderson set the tone with a four-birdie streak right out of the gate. Wichanee Meechai fired off a birdie-eagle-birdie start that had the gallery whispering and the crows cawing. Chisato Iwai, blending in with her Oregon green top, finished at three under, highlighted by an impressive eagle on the 463-yard par-5 seventh.

American Gurleen Kaur posted up eight birdies, while China's Miranda Wang navigated around the towering trees to card a bogey-free round, saving par eleven times. Abacaya Yubol kept her card clean with twelve pars and no bogeys, finishing the day tied for fourth alongside Haeran Ryu. Jin Young Ko of South Korea delivered a commanding performance, carding a five-under-par round with 13 pars and five birdies.

In the afternoon wave, rookie Adéla Cernousek and fellow Frenchwoman Perrine Delacour made their presence felt, finishing at 8-under and 6-under, respectively.

So, at the end of Round 1 Adéla Cernousek rests alone atop the leaderboard at 8-under. A five-way logjam at 7-under sees Henderson, Kaur, Lee5, Park, and M. Wang all in the mix, while a tightly packed chase group -- including Buhai, Grant, Ryu, Yubol, and Delacour -- tied for seventh, keeps the tension high heading into Round 2.

## Round 1 Competition Highlights

**Brooke Henderson** stuck a solid third shot on the par-5 10th for birdie to start her round, added another on 11, and went a perfect four-for-four on birdies through 13.

**Adéla Cernousek**, the rookie from Antibes, France, showcased her technical, course management driven style to finish alone in first at 8-under including an eagle on 7.

**Caroline Masson's** 7-iron at the par-3 second was so pure she didn't even see it disappear. Hidden behind a bunker, the ball found the cup for her first ace of the year, sending a ripple of cheers across the gallery.

**Perrine Delacour**, currently ranked 118 in the world, had a phenomenal day posting 4 birdies on the front 9 and finishing tied for 7th.

**Rose Zhang**, hindered by injury and a stop-start schedule struggled early, including double bogeys on 10 and 13, never quite finding her rhythm.

**Wichanee Meechai** fired off a birdie-eagle-birdie start but finished even for the day.

**Lilia Vu** was working to regain the form that once took her to World No. 1. 16 pars and 1 birdie on the day to end even.

**Caroline Inglis** playing on her home course came close to recreating her past heroics at the 13th, setting up a short birdie putt and finishing at 2-under.

**Chisato Iwai**, blending in with her Oregon green top, finished at three under, highlighted by an impressive eagle on the 463-yard par-5 seventh.

**Jin Young Ko's** ball striking was sharp all day, producing a commanding five-under round built on 13 pars and five birdies.

**Lauren Coughlin** pushed her way to four-under with a strong putting performance and an aggressive approach off the tees.

**Yuka Saso** carded four birdies, but double bogeys on 9 and 11 knocked her back, leaving her at 6-over for the day.

**Abacaya Yubol** held a one-shot lead at one point and kept a spotless card with twelve pars and no bogeys, ending the day tied for 6th.

American **Gurleen Kaur** posted eight birdies.

**Gigi Stoll** stumbled with a triple bogey on the 426-yard par-4 third but recovered to shoot an even-par 72 for the round.

## Shout Out

Filipino golf fans have reason to be excited as **Dottie Ardina** posted a superb -3 for the day. Ardina looked incredibly sharp throughout her round, displaying a level of control and confidence that suggests her game may reach top form over the course of the weekend.

## Gear Notes

Brooke Henderson is playing with a new TaylorMade Spider putter, fitted with a [Garsen Quad Tour NT grip](https://garsengolf.com/).30:Te16,I've picked up my share of Titleist Pro V1s and Srixon Z-STARs. Balls lost and found like trophies from roughs and water hazards. I keep a handful in my bag, pulling them out when I'm convinced my slice has checked out for good. Call it superstition, but those balls start feeling like more than just urethane. But now, I have a new favorite: Champ. Or Champy, as Marie and I call him, the mascot of [The Dow Championship](https://dowchampionship.com/).

Why Champy? It's not sold in fun colors and doesn't offer a short game spin that my skills barely benefit from. Well, it's garnered something else from me: admiration.

June was a scorcher for players, right? Texas bakes them in the mid-90s with a heat index over 100 degrees. Then, windburned and weary, they haul themselves up north to Michigan, where it's a refreshing 75 to 80. And what else do they get when they roll into Midland Country Club? Not just a cozy golf course and a friendly crowd—but Champy, on its first birthday, dishing out cupcakes [next to a loon](https://www.milb.com/great-lakes/ballpark/lou-e). That's just part of what makes Champy and The Dow so admirable.

There's warmth and intimacy you don't find everywhere. It's a tight-knit Midwestern golf community where Dow employees and folks from neighboring towns show up shoulder-to-shoulder to cheer on the players and sing happy birthday to a giant, fluffy golf ball. It's a team event, too—the sort that can jolt a player's season back to life when the grind starts wearing thin. You can sense how much the players love it. You catch it in the laughter, feel it buzzing in the air, and see it shining through playful team names like Biggie Smalls, the Kilted Koalas, and Born to the Islands.

And all this aids the LPGA Tour in being more than a series of tournaments that showcases top-tier talent--it attracts new fans by mixing competition with that genuine community spirit. It is helping the game grow beyond the usual circles, bringing fresh eyes and enthusiasm to the sport. It makes the LPGA an even more powerful platform for promoting women's golf worldwide.

It's also where sponsorships make a real difference. Partnerships like Dow's don't just keep the tournament running; they fuel the visibility and opportunities female athletes need to thrive. In a world where women's sports still fight for equal airtime and funding, these sponsorships help bridge the gap, allowing players to chase their dreams and providing a venue for fans to watch.

And speaking of admiration, the tournament's ambassador, Suzann Pettersen, also embodies everything this event stands for. As a Solheim Cup captain, two-time major champion, and founder of [TeamVOXA(an athlete-first talent management group)](https://teamvoxa.com/), she's more than just a name. She's a role model who shows young girls what's possible when determination meets opportunity. Her leadership and vision help light the path for the next generation of female golfers, proving that success on and off the course goes hand in hand.

So yes, Champy might not spin like a Pro V1, but it's got heart and hustle and is the face of what's arguably one of the best weeks on the LPGA calendar. And it knows how to host the kind of party where the buzz never fades, strangers turn into friends, and the drama on the course has a rival in the fun and growth happening off it.

It’s the kind of experience that folds itself into you and reminds you why we watch, why we play, and why, no matter the ball in your bag, the soul of the game stays with you long after Champy blows out the candles.31:Ta4d,Let's put it plainly: Jeeno Thitikul is the best golfer in the world right now, and she did it by finishing tied for 30th at the AIG Women's Open.

We all saw it coming. Week after week, we kept asking the same thing: is this the one? And now here we are: the 22-year-old from Bangkok back on top of the Rolex Rankings. The moment came with a +1 at Porthcawl while Nelly Korda finished at +3, ending her impressive 71-week run at number one. No spotlight needed, just steady golf and the kind of composure typically reserved for Ariya Jutanugarn.

In this age where it sometimes feels we want immediate viral moments and the kind of fuss made for streaming services, Jeeno did this her way. She methodically chipped away at the rankings. You wouldn't have known it from her face Sunday, but there was triumph in her walk -- not a swagger, but that Ariya-esque stride, crossing dunes as if untouched by scores or poorly placed backboards that can hug a green. When asked about the ranking afterward, she said, "Sometimes, it's just about surviving the week."

When the week was over, did she celebrate? Of course. Maybe with an iced coffee, hold the ice, with her friend Ronnie Yin.

Jeeno's numbers support all this: eight top-10 finishes, runner-up at HSBC and Evian, and a win at the Mizuho Americas Open. Beyond the colorful grips, her iron game is sharp -- leading the tour with over 77% greens in regulation and averaging 4.6 birdies per round. She's a quietly relentless force among the best this season.

Let's not forget, this isn't Jeeno's first time. She was No. 1 in 2022, at just 19. That stint lasted two weeks -- roughly the same amount of time the PGA of America stays concerned with a player who punches up a historic country club's locker room. But she's back now, again without a major win. Older, calmer, and in absolutely no rush to appease anybody. If there's a deeper well of fortitude on tour, I haven't seen it.

Jeeno isn't here for the drama either, though some unintentionally [found her at Evian](https://ladieseuropeantour.com/blog/kim-claims-maiden-major-title-in-dramatic-playoff-at-the-amundi-evian-championship). What she is here for is the long game: contesting 20+ tournaments a season and quietly reclaiming the top spot from whoever assumed it was theirs. And when that major finally lands--and it will--don't expect a victory lap. Just a quiet nod, that trademark grin, and then she's off again, pin-seeking like nothing ever happened.

And the greater truth? Jeeno doesn't even need a major to have her place among the game's best. That's exactly what makes her so brilliant to watch.32:T9f6,At Columbia Edgewater Country Club, the greens are ready as one of the LPGA Tour's enduring pillars returns under a new banner. [The Standard Insurance Company](https://www.standard.com/get-to-know-standard/newsroom/press-releases/standard-portland-classic-welcomes-top-women-golfers-aug-14-17-2025) has stepped in with a 3-year commitment as title sponsor for the longest-running non-major on the LPGA Tour, reaffirming tradition, evolution, and a celebration of women golf's.

Founded in 1972, this tournament is woven into the sport's fabric. From the team event era of the late '70s to its transformation into a 72-hole since 2013, it has crowned legends like Annika Sörenstam, Nancy Lopez, and Brooke Henderson, and raised over $18 million for children's charities in the Pacific Northwest.

Recent champions have written compelling chapter arcs: in 2024, Moriya Jutanugarn charged a final-round 66 to seize her third LPGA Tour win. In 2023, 19-year-old Chanettee Wannasaen, a Monday qualifier, erased nine straight missed cuts in her season and broke the course record with a –26 to claim her first LPGA win.

But the Portland Classic is more than a gallery of champions. It's a festival of community and engagement. This year, fans can look forward to a Les Schwab Tires Par-3 Tournament on August 16, where LPGA professionals mentor aspiring junior girls across the holes.

A Portland favorite, The Sports Bra, will have a pop-up bar on hole 15, complete with shaded seating perched above one of the tournament's pivotal holes. There is also the Umpqua Family Fun Zone with golf games, local food vendors, giveaways, and further charity programming through First Tee - Oregon.

It's business and beauty. Volunteers and values. As Amy Malagamba of The Standard notes, "The Classic is more than a golf tournament -- it's a celebration of excellence, perseverance and community."

That spirit, like the greens of Columbia Edgewater, remains timeless.

[Tickets](https://www.portlandclassic.com/ticket-information) for The Standard Portland Classic are on sale now, starting from $25. Fans seeking a closer vantage can opt for upgraded passes with VIP seating inside the Champions Club, while a special combo package pairs tournament access with a ticket to the Portland Thorns FC match on August 10. On August 15, $5 from every ticket purchased will be donated to the Sunshine Division. As ever, juniors aged 17 and under are welcomed free of charge, ensuring the next generation can experience golf's greatest players up close.33:Tf90,By all accounts, Charley Hull should have collapsed again, physically or metaphorically. She said herself she came into the AIG Women's Open thinking she wouldn't make the cut. That's not just false modesty; she [collapsed at Evian](https://www.skratch.golf/news/news/charley-hull-evian-illness-update-womens-scottish-open), suffered a back injury that limited her practice time, and still showed up at Royal Porthcawl like she'd just fought off an adder with a long iron.

And yet, there she was on Sunday afternoon -- the crowd surging like the tide, the wind sweeping through with the rhythm of a Dylan Thomas verse, moody and irregular -- finishing runner-up in a major she supposedly had no business contending in at all.

Hull's round was a feast of nearly. Nearly pure. Nearly birdie. Nearly glory. But not a drop of regret on the plate. Watching the coverage, one could see her standing in the mixed zone afterward, giving the kind of interview that makes media hover nervously and a certain type of fan lean in.

"I didn't even hit a bad shot on 16," she said, with the conviction of someone who knows. "I hit it so pure the wind didn't even move it an inch."

Golfers can lie, but Hull? Hull might be the rare one telling too much truth. No fibbing about misreads or nerves. No humble bragging about grinding it out. She hit it well. The Welsh wind didn't care. The goddesses of Avalon shrugged. So she moved on.

On 17, she missed a putt she struck well. On 18, she had a high chip over a bunker that would give anyone but Grace Kim flop sweats. She got it close, didn't hole the putt, and signed for a round that any rational player would be proud of. Yet rationality and Major Sundays don't mix.

"I felt like I was in control of my game today. I don't feel like I mis-hit any shots. I hit it pretty pure."

And then, the shrug. Not literal, she's professional and too composed for that, but the verbal equivalent came later, wrapped in adrenaline and her dry delivery:

"At the end of the day, it's just a game."

Of course, that's a lie, too. But a necessary one. Because this *just a game* nearly turned into *her game*. She got within one shot twice and didn't know it because she never looked at a leaderboard.

"Was I even in the lead?"

Had she asked any louder, someone might've howled the scores from the ropes. But Hull's never been one to need numbers to trust her instincts. She plays like someone raised on turf, who learned to spin wedges by feel, and prefers her caddie point out the hole locations like he's holding a map drawn in pencil. Visualizing links shots, she admits, is not her thing. She prefers targets. Trees. Something there.

So of course, she found herself in contention beside Rest Bay, her deeds anything but frail in a place where the target is often "that ragged tuft beyond the dune" or "one bounce shy of the gorse bush left of the TV tower."

"I don't really like links," she said in May. She doubled down on that post-round. "It doesn't suit me. I find it hard to visualize shots."

Watching Hull is like watching someone play poker while forgetting the rules halfway through and still walks off with a straight flush. Her strategy is unconventional, her swing aggressive in the way tavern arguments are aggressive, and her commentary refreshingly unfiltered.

She's also, by her own admission, "kind of insane sometimes." But maybe you have to be? Chasing a major, riding the crowd, three collapses behind you, and the cut line forgotten.

"I hit wayward shots," she said. "But I can get up-and-down and stuff."

That's not just a quote. That's a philosophy. Embroider it on your jumper.

Charley Hull won't be satisfied with another second place, and neither should you. And if you're looking for a true soul of women's golf, the kind that will not go gentle into that good night (or press tent), she's out there plumbobing her putter: a little chipped, a little cheeky, and unmistakably alive.23:["$","$L24",null,{"articles":[{"id":"fm-championship-round-1-2025","slug":"fm-championship-round-1-2025","title":"FM Championship Opening Round: Shadoff Leads Amid Birdie Filled Action","author":"George Hack","authorId":"george-hack","date":"2025-08-29","category":"Tournament Golf","excerpt":"Thursday's opening round of the FM Championship delivered birdies, sharp iron play, and putting that made the greens at TPC Boston feel alive.
