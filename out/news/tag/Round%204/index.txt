29:Tb3a,Miranda Wang, the rookie from China who made her name at Duke and ground her way through the Epson Tour, finally turned years of effort into triumph, holding off World No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul to claim her first LPGA title at the FM Championship.

She entered Sunday with a three-shot lead and clung to it most of the way. The 15th hole nearly unraveled her—an errant fairway shot, a rare flash of urgency, and a break from her usual pre-shot routine led to bogey, dropping her a shot behind Thitikul. But Wang steadied herself quickly: she brushed off a missed birdie on 16, then answered with a flawless approach to six feet on 17 and buried the putt to retake the lead. Thitikul, meanwhile, blinked—her chip skidding across the green and setting up a bogey.

“I felt like this could be my week,” Wang said, recalling how her front-nine 29 on Thursday set the tone. “The shots and putts were going so well for me… I just worked really hard and didn’t give up on that.” A composed two-putt par on 18 sealed her 20-under 268 and a $615,000 winner’s check, punctuated by champagne showers from Rose Zhang, her final-round partner and longtime friend.

The win is another step in an impressive journey. Wang helped the Blue Devils capture the 2019 NCAA team title, was the 2022 WAPT Player of the Year, and now joins Shanshan Feng and Ronni Yin as one of China’s LPGA champions—while also becoming the fourth Duke alum to win on tour.

Thitikul, sharp as ever with her irons and putter, finished a shot back at 19 under. Sei Young Kim took solo third, Andrea Lee fourth, and Jin Hee Im tied with Rose Zhang for fifth after a record-tying 10-under 62 on Sunday.

It all underscores the LPGA’s depth this year: 24 winners across 23 events. Wang’s performance adds another, now including 7 rookies.

“Winning on the LPGA has been my dream since I was eight,” Wang said. “I hope this is just the first of many, and I’ll keep pushing myself.” At The FM Championship, her patience, precision, and determination came together beautifully. Here’s to Miranda and her win. A fitting moment in the LPGA’s 75th season--one that keeps finding new ways to thrill.

## Round 4 Competition Highlights

## Gear Notes

At the time of writing, there’s nothing significant to report.2a:Tfd8,This wasn't a Sunday stroll along the river for Brooke Henderson. It was a duel. A final round that felt less like stroke play and more like match play, where every birdie and every answer from Minjee Lee hung heavy in the air. By the time Henderson rolled in her final putt and lifted the trophy, the Canadian galleries had their dream ending -- their star back on top, on home soil, for the first time in more than two years.

Henderson's closing 4-under 67 at Mississaugua pushed her to 15 under, one shot clear of Lee's 68. The win marked her second CPKC Women's Open title, her 14th career victory on the LPGA Tour, and an emphatic end to a drought that had stretched across 64 starts.

"This week was beyond special," Henderson said, standing behind the 18th green. "To be able to win my national open again, in front of these crowds… it feels surreal."

**A Sunday Match Play**

The day began with Henderson and Lee tied at 11 under, three clear of the field. The crowd sensed it early: this was no longer a four-day tournament but a head-to-head contest between Canada's brightest star and one of the game's most polished champions.

The momentum swung like a pendulum. At the par-5 13th, Henderson nearly eagled but settled for birdie. Lee answered, rolling in her own. On the very next hole, the pivotal par-3 14th, Henderson made a pure 6-foot birdie putt for a one-stroke lead.

Then came a behind the netter. On the 17th, with the gallery encircling the short par-4, Lee drained a 13-footer for birdie. The roar barely settled before Henderson stepped up and buried her own from 12 feet. Birdie for birdie.

Lee smiled. Henderson clenched her fist. The match ever so tilted Henderson's way. She carried that one-stroke edge to the house.

"I kind of got outplayed," Lee admitted, gracious in defeat. "I did my job. But Brooke was just a little better today."

**A Career Marker**

For Henderson, 27, the victory carries more weight than just number 14 on her career tally. This was her first title since the Diamond Resorts Tournament of Champions in January 2023, and it arrived after months of doubt, struggle, and slipping down the world rankings.

She is projected to leap back into the top 30 in the Race to CME Globe, securing her spot in the season-ending CME Group Tour Championship. More importantly, she reminded herself -- and everyone else -- what a locked-in Brooke Henderson looks like.

When she first won this championship in 2018 at Wascana, she became the first Canadian in 45 years to lift the national title. To do it again, seven years later, in front of her home fans felt like the circle closing once more.

"I thought I might cry, honestly," Henderson said. "It's just been so long. I felt like this week was meant to be."

To our Canadian friends across the Great Lakes, to the thunderous galleries, to those filling sports bars from coast to coast, and to the entire Canadian golf community -- bravo for the way you carried Henderson. Even her peers seemed to understand the weight of the moment. She had fought through doubts and close calls, only to find her game again when the stage demanded it. And so, a Canadian classic was written.

## Round 4 Competition Highlights

**Henderson's** birdie on 14 gave her the solo lead — and she never gave it back.

**Minjee Lee** holed a birdie from 13 feet only for Henderson to answer immediately with her own from 12.

**The galleries around Henderson were massive**, the kind of Canadian following that was Ryder Cup-sized at times.

**Henderson's** up-and-downs on 15 and 16 held her lead steady in the tightest stretch of the round.

Fifteen-year-old phenom **Aphrodite Deng** tied for 20th at 4 under, capping a remarkable week.

**Mao Saigo** finished third at 11 under.

**Akie Iwai**, who led after two rounds, settled for fourth.

## Shout Out

**Canada's** steadfast support for its sports stars was nothing short of inspiring.

## Gear Notes

Henderson sealed the win playing a TaylorMade TP5x golf ball.2b:Tf83,Akie Iwai's first win had been circling all season, tapping her shoulder in Thailand, wagging its finger in Los Angeles. Then she watched her twin sister, Chisato, sip champagne in Mexico while she smiled through the twinge of being the other half of the story. On Sunday in Portland, she finally got to write her own ending.

The 23-year-old rookie from Saitama closed with a bogey-free 66 to win The Standard Portland Classic by four, finishing at 24-under. Six birdies and no errors -- the kind of round players dream about but rarely manage when it matters most. She birdied Nos. 5 and 6 to settle herself, then went about the back nine like a painter, deliberate and precise in her strokes. She sealed the victory with birdies on 17 and 18, the last an 18-footer that rolled in with the composure of a player who had already made up her mind about the outcome.

That's when sister Chisato came running across the green, champagne bottle in hand. If the LPGA is still searching for its next great sibling storyline, it found it in that moment -- a younger sister by sixty seconds dousing her twin in fizzy, French affirmation.

The rest of the field deserves their ink. American Gurleen Kaur posted her career-best finish, runner-up at 20-under, and appeared like a player eager to keep going if only there had been a fifth round to play. Linn Grant shared third with Chisato, and Grace Kim stayed in the conversation at 18-under. Even Oregon amateur Kiara Romero made noise with a 64 and a tie for seventh, giving the local Ducks faithful a glimpse of the future. But in truth, the week belonged to Akie.

Her win folds neatly into a larger Japanese surge on tour this year. She became the fifth from her country to win in 2025, joining Chisato, Rio Takeda, Mao Saigo, and British Open champion Miyu Yamashita. It feels less like coincidence and more like a movement, each name sharpening the edge of Japanese golf. And by winning, Akie and Chisato joined a rare sorority -- sisters etched into LPGA history alongside the Kordas, the Jutanugarns, and the Sorenstams.

What will linger from this Sunday, though, isn't the data. It's the image of Akie exhaling on the 72nd green, her mother in tears nearby, the pressure of all those close calls finally lifting.

And so, among the verdure of Portland's towering trees and fairways, Akie Iwai hoisted her first LPGA trophy, champagne-soaked and smiling. She departed Columbia Edgewater no longer the twin giving chase, but the one who had at last arrived.

## Final Round Competition Highlights

**Grace Kim** two back entering the day, led the field in putting despite a couple of three-putts this week; she rolled 3 key birdies on the back nine to finish in 5th with an 18 under 270

**Gurleen Kaur** bounced back from a slow start yesterday, birdieing the 7th, 9th, 10th, and 17th holes, with accurate wedge shots, bringing her within a shot of the lead several times.

**Chisato Iwai** already an LPGA winner; eagled multiple par fives to finish the day at a 64

**Linn Grant** delivered an impressive weekend with rounds of 66-71-65-67. Could she be next to capture a tournament victory? We certainly hope so.

**Aditi Ashok** finished strong, carding three late birdies to reach 17-under, highlighting a standout performance.

**Akie Iwai** sank crucial putts down the stretch, including a long one on the 18th, to secure her win of The Standard Portland Classic and join her sister Chisato as an LPGA champion.

## Shout Out

**Gurleen Kaur** comes in solo second. Exactly the kind of golf we want to see more of!
