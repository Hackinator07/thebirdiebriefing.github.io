21:T10b7,Fall golf has arrived, and with it, the LPGA Tour is in its home stretch for 2025. Just eight regular-season events and a stint through Asia remain before the [CME Group Tour Championship](https://www.cmegrouptourchampionship.com/). That means playing opportunities and CME points are becoming scarce. The great news is the 19th edition of the Walmart NW Arkansas Championship offers players a chance at a $3 million purse and 500 CME points (for the winner) over just 54 holes! 

**The Venue**

Since 2007 Pinnacle Country Club has played host to the championship. Once farmland in the hills of Rogers, it was transformed into a private club in 1990 with help from architect Don Sechrest and PGA player Bruce Lietzke. Reimagined by Randy Heckenkemper in 2009, Pinnacle has become one of the LPGA Tour's most reliable stages. It has wide fairways and from video reviews it seems to invite aggressive play. The real wild card for 2025 is the rain in the forecast which could cause delays, soft spots, and bumpy lies. Don't be surprised if the scores run higher than what we've seen in recent years. *You can hit the new Course Info tab in the scorecard on our website for all the details, but here's the quick version: it's a par 71 playing 6,438 yards. The Aon Risk Reward hole is the 14th -- a 549-yard par 5 that doglegs left and makes players consider clubs off the tee and plan for the sloped fairway and green.*

**Play on Playa(s)**

For the first time since 2022, Nelly Korda returns to Pinnacle. She missed the cut in her last trip but comes in on form, fresh off a T5 in Cincinnati.

World No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul, the 2022 champion, is sitting out this week, opening the door for someone else to grab momentum heading into the fall. Perhaps this is for the best so she can mentally regroup after her loss at Queen City to Charley Hull.

Reigning U.S. Women's Open champion Maja Stark is back after a T5 in Cincinnati. It was her best result since winning her major at Erin Hills. Look to see if she can keep the momentum rolling.

Rookies Miyu Yamashita and Lottie Woad, two of the season's brightest stories, will be in contention. Both finished inside the top five last week and will be making their Pinnacle debuts.

Past champions Haeran Ryu (2023), Nasa Hataoka (2021, 2018), and Stacy Lewis (2014, 2007) are also in the mix. Hataoka comes in with back-to-back top 10s and a track record of strong play on this course. As I type this I think she may have a go at winning here again this year.

**Sponsor Invitees**

Sponsor invites in the field are Maria Marin and Maria Fassi.

**Tickets, Sushi, Viewing Decks, and Parking**

General admission is $10 per day or $25 for the week, with free admission for kids 17 and under. The [BITE Experience ($50 daily) showcases local restaurants and culture. Looking over the menu it spans from steak, to sushi, to fried chicken, even a charcuterie & wine bar!](https://bitenwa.com/tickets?utm_source=chatgpt.com) The host nation has the Choctaw Club ($75 daily) which offers upgraded hospitality overlooking the island green at 15.

Fans can also enjoy free public viewing decks, affordable concessions at Tyson Cafes, and the lively "Gatorade Loudest Hole on Tour" at 17—where traditional golf etiquette gets put on hold. Double Waterhazards, anyone?

General parking Tuesday through Thursday is at the Rogers Convention Center [(3303 S Pinnacle Hills Pkwy)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ktFmZqnciiAc8oDD9), with shuttles running straight to the main admissions entrance at Pinnacle Country Club.

Friday through Sunday, general parking moves to the lot behind the Walmart Neighborhood Market off Exit 83 [(4501 S Pinnacle Hills Pkwy)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mqjdKuE469jzahFE7), where shuttles will also take fans directly to the main entrance.

*Note: Reddit user u/gorkatron had excellent feedback here, pointing out that while most fans focus on the race to the CME and the top 60, the battles for top 80 (priority status for next season) and top 100 (keeping your LPGA card without Q school) are just as crucial. Most players chasing those spots only have three more opportunities to earn points: this event, The Lotte Championship, and The ANNIKA, with the Asian events being limited-field.*22:Td60,[The Kroger Queen City Championship presented by P&G](https://queencitylpga.com/) is coming back to Ohio, and this week it lands again at TPC River’s Bend, a course carved into the rolling hills just north of Cincinnati. From September 11–14, 144 of the best players in the world will tee it up for a $2 million purse, and with the way this LPGA season has gone—no repeat winners yet—the story feels wide open.

River’s Bend isn’t new to big stages. The course hosted the PGA TOUR Champions Kroger Classic, the Korn Ferry Tour’s Chiquita Classic, and the Epson Tour’s Prasco Charity Championship. Built in 2001, it’s an Arnold Palmer and Ed Seay course that asks players to hit every shot in the bag and has been called one of the best new private clubs in the country. It’s big enough for the crowds and precise enough to expose mistakes. It should be a compelling canvas for where the leaderboard will shift from day to day, and you’ll see desperate charges just to cling to the cut, along with the kind of bottom-of-the-board wreckage that draws out the morbidly curious.

**Key Players to Follow**

**Heather Lin** and **Polly Mack** punched their tickets through Monday qualifying, carding 3-under 69s to snag the final spots in a field that’s as stacked as the tour has seen short of a major. Keep an eye on Lin and Mack—they’ve already proven they can hang with the best, and this week, they could turn heads.

Defending champion **Lydia Ko** returns with the kind of iron will and ball-striking that makes her a natural favorite. After a five-stroke cinch here last year and a season highlighted by her 23rd career win at the HSBC Women’s World Championship, expect her near the top come Sunday.

[World No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul](https://www.birdiebriefing.com/news/jeeno-thitikul-quiet-stride/) demands attention. The breaks are due to tilt her way. Four top-10s in six starts prove she’s steady, but she remembers the sting of finishing runner-up to Ko here last year—and she’s not planning to let that happen again.

And keep an eye on **Minjee Lee**, the 2023 Queen City winner, who’s racking up top finishes all season, including a KPMG Women’s PGA victory. With the Rolex Player of the Year and CME Globe races heating up, she’s right on the leaders’ heels and tops the LPGA money list. Expect her to run the boards with confident putting and push hard every step of the way this week.

**Be Part of It**

Kroger and P&G are betting big on what this tournament stands for: world-class women’s golf in Cincinnati and a stage for more than just the game. They’ve called in Outlyr—the folks behind the Meijer Classic and Dow Championship—so expect more than a typical tour stop. Smooth organization, a welcoming vibe, and something to see around every corner.

There will be general [admission tickets](https://queencitylpga.com/tickets/) at $59.16 weekly, or $29.58 daily. Champions Club will be $757.25 weekly or $201.14 daily. Active duty, veterans, reservists, National Guard, and first responders receive free daily admission with ID or service verification. Children 17 & under get free daily grounds admission with a ticketed adult.

Queen City is lining up the sharpest field on the planet in a season still figuring out its story. It might crown a repeat winner or throw a curve no one saw coming. Either way, you’ll want to be there.23:Tc24,The LPGA’s top golfers tee off this week at the 2025 FM Championship, running August 28-31 at TPC Boston. With a $4.1 million prize purse, the event ranks among the biggest on the LPGA Tour outside of the major championships.

**The Venue**

TPC Boston is a New England venue shaped with design elements reminiscent of golf’s old-country heritage.  Arnold Palmer laid down the original plan in 2003, but four years later [Gil Hanse]( https://www.hansegolfdesign.com/) and PGA Tour player [Brad Faxon]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Faxon) were called in to rough it up. Their job was to make the course feel less like a set of lines on paper and more like a stretch of New England countryside you might wander across. They succeeded.

Don’t let the pastoral charm fool you. TPC Boston has its tests, and they show most clearly at the 18th. Nicknamed the “Hell Hole,” it plays 504 yards for the tournament with "birdie" written on the scorecard, but it can easily wreck a round. Trouble lurks everywhere: bunkers right, slopes that reject even well-struck wedges. The hole has humbled more players than it has rewarded. Reach the green in one piece, and a par feels like a small victory; a birdie, a cause for celebration. [Haeran Ryu herself birdied 18 in 2024]( https://youtu.be/S7k6bxwnpC0?t=346) to win in a playoff against Jin Young Ko.

**LPGA’s Elite Players Tee Off Again**

Thirty-six of the top 40 players in the Rolex Women’s World Golf Rankings are here, led by No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul and No. 2 Nelly Korda. There are 70 LPGA Tour winners in the mix, including defending champ Haeran Ryu and last year’s runner-up, Jin Young Ko. Every single one of the 2025 major champions will be swinging, and 21 of this year’s 23 LPGA Tour winners are on hand.

Local fans have some familiar faces to cheer for: Massachusetts natives Megan Khang (Rockland), Brittany Altomare (Shrewsbury), and Alexa Pano (Westborough) will all be in the mix. Add two top amateurs--Megha Ganne and Amelie Zalsman--, and you’ve got a field that’s part global powerhouse, part hometown story.

**Be Part of It**

In partnership with SERVPRO, the LPGA is providing complimentary grounds admission for current and former U.S. military members. Additionally, juniors 17 and under can attend free when accompanied by an adult with a purchased ticket.24:T17d0,The 51st CPKC Women's Open doesn't just look like a major, it feels like it. The field would pass for one in any corner of the golf world. 156 players are here, six of them sitting in the Rolex top 10, and every one chasing a slice of $2.75 million and the chance to carve their name on the open trophy.

**The Venue**

This year's Canadian Open takes place on the fairways of Mississaugua Golf & Country Club, a course that carries real gravitas. The Credit River winds through its valley, shaping a landscape at once pastoral and formidable. The greens and bunkers, refined by Donald Ross, still bear the original mark of George Cumming's design. And as the spotlight shines, Canada is poised to put its finest golf and hospitality on display for us. 

It is important to recognize that this course stands on the traditional lands of the [Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation](https://mncfn.ca/), whose history and connection to this traditional territory carries significance greater than the game played upon it.

**The Past in Play**

For some in the field, Mississaugua is not entirely new ground. In 2016, the club hosted the World Junior Girls Championship, where Yuka Saso hoisted the individual trophy while leading the Philippines to a team win. She's back now as a two-time U.S. Women's Open champion, looking to rediscover the magic of those fairways. Alongside her are Haeran Ryu, Maja Stark, and Esther Henseleit -- players who also walked these grounds in that juniors championship and now return as proven winners.

**Maple Leaf Standouts**

Brooke Henderson, the face of Canadian golf and a 13-time LPGA Tour winner, is in the field and hot off a T23 finish in Portland. Henderson's 2018 triumph at this championship remains one of the defining moments in Canadian sport, ending a 45-year drought and being the first national win since Jocelyne Bourassa in 1973. She leads a group of Canadians in the field, each chasing that same dream of lifting their country's championship trophy on home soil (maybe sneaking in a few celebratory Tim Hortons Timbiebs for good measure).

**The World's Best Are Back**

[Newly crowned No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul](https://www.birdiebriefing.com/news/jeeno-thitikul-quiet-stride/) makes her first start since climbing past Nelly Korda in the rankings. Korda, meanwhile, is still searching for her first win of 2025 despite a season full of close calls. Lydia Ko, a three-time winner of the Canadian Open, returns with the kind of experience that makes her dangerous. And rising star Lottie Woad, riding wins in Ireland and Scotland, adds another layer of intrigue to an already loaded entry list.

**Coughlin Returns**

[At Earl Grey Golf Club](https://earlgreygolfclub.com/) in Calgary last year, Lauren Coughlin finally cracked through with her first LPGA victory at this very event. That win ignited a streak that carried her to a second title at Dundonald and a victorious debut in the Solheim Cup. Now, back in Canada to defend, she brings momentum with her, a T7 finish last week in Portland.

**Sponsor Invitees**

The championship has also welcomed sponsor invites that ensure the next wave has its chance to shine. Ontario's Alena Sharp and Quebec's Maude-Aimée Leblanc are in the field, joined by rising amateurs like Anna Davis, Carla Bernat Escuder, and U.S. Women's Amateur champion Megha Ganne.

**Sustainable Approach**

Golf Canada is raising the bar on sustainability at the Open, aiming to make the tournament zero-waste and carbon-neutral. Partnering with the Green Event Ninjas, the event has already diverted 75% of waste, recycled thousands of kilograms of material, and eliminated nearly 68,000 single-use water bottles. With fans encouraged to bike, carpool, and engage in eco-friendly practices, the Open is setting a new standard for environmental responsibility.

**Be Part of It**

The CPKC Women's Open is a full-on festival for fans of all ages, and this year there are plenty of ways to make your tournament experience unforgettable. [General admission tickets](https://www.cpkcwomensopen.com/tickets/) start at $21 for Wednesday, $52 Thursday through Saturday, and $63 for Sunday. A full-week pass is available for $147. Juniors 12 and under get free grounds access when accompanied by an adult, and those 13–17 enjoy a 15% discount on specific single-day grounds tickets, making it easy to bring the next generation of fans to the action.

For those looking to elevate the experience, the **Heritage Lounge** offers an exclusive viewing deck between the 11th and 12th holes, complete with covered seating, upgraded food and beverage, reserved washrooms, and closed-circuit televisions.

Fans can also upgrade their tickets for $30 per day to access the themed 10th hole, The Rink. Yes, we're talking puckboards. Somebody better roll in with an [Odyssey Hockey Stick Putter](https://odyssey.callawaygolf.com/putters/putters-2025-happy-gilmore.html) while wearing a hockey jersey. What's more, your upgrade is a donation to support MacKids, and every dollar will be matched by CPKC.

The CPKC fan experiences beyond The Rink include the First Tee Long Putt Challenge, golf-inspired carnival games, Autograph Alley presented by Golf Town, and two Brooke Brigade viewing zones that give juniors front-row access to the 1st and 15th greens. Participants also get t-shirts, snacks, and drinks, making it a full-on fan experience for all.

So whether you're chasing the thrill of the leaderboard, enjoying the festival atmosphere, or simply looking for a unique day out with family and friends, the CPKC Women's Open delivers a chance to see the world's best up close while creating memories that last.

And remember -- keep your stick on the ice.

Anyone who's played the restored Kenosha or another Ross course knows how effortlessly his designs merge with the natural terrain.*25:T9f6,At Columbia Edgewater Country Club, the greens are ready as one of the LPGA Tour's enduring pillars returns under a new banner. [The Standard Insurance Company](https://www.standard.com/get-to-know-standard/newsroom/press-releases/standard-portland-classic-welcomes-top-women-golfers-aug-14-17-2025) has stepped in with a 3-year commitment as title sponsor for the longest-running non-major on the LPGA Tour, reaffirming tradition, evolution, and a celebration of women golf's.

Founded in 1972, this tournament is woven into the sport's fabric. From the team event era of the late '70s to its transformation into a 72-hole since 2013, it has crowned legends like Annika Sörenstam, Nancy Lopez, and Brooke Henderson, and raised over $18 million for children's charities in the Pacific Northwest.

Recent champions have written compelling chapter arcs: in 2024, Moriya Jutanugarn charged a final-round 66 to seize her third LPGA Tour win. In 2023, 19-year-old Chanettee Wannasaen, a Monday qualifier, erased nine straight missed cuts in her season and broke the course record with a –26 to claim her first LPGA win.

But the Portland Classic is more than a gallery of champions. It's a festival of community and engagement. This year, fans can look forward to a Les Schwab Tires Par-3 Tournament on August 16, where LPGA professionals mentor aspiring junior girls across the holes.

A Portland favorite, The Sports Bra, will have a pop-up bar on hole 15, complete with shaded seating perched above one of the tournament's pivotal holes. There is also the Umpqua Family Fun Zone with golf games, local food vendors, giveaways, and further charity programming through First Tee - Oregon.

It's business and beauty. Volunteers and values. As Amy Malagamba of The Standard notes, "The Classic is more than a golf tournament -- it's a celebration of excellence, perseverance and community."

That spirit, like the greens of Columbia Edgewater, remains timeless.

[Tickets](https://www.portlandclassic.com/ticket-information) for The Standard Portland Classic are on sale now, starting from $25. Fans seeking a closer vantage can opt for upgraded passes with VIP seating inside the Champions Club, while a special combo package pairs tournament access with a ticket to the Portland Thorns FC match on August 10. On August 15, $5 from every ticket purchased will be donated to the Sunshine Division. As ever, juniors aged 17 and under are welcomed free of charge, ensuring the next generation can experience golf's greatest players up close.1f:["$","div",null,{"className":"bg-white min-h-screen","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-8","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-col lg:flex-row gap-8","children":[["$","main",null,{"className":"flex-1 max-w-4xl","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-center gap-4","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 leading-tight tracking-tight","children":"Tournament%20Preview"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex-1 h-px bg-gray-300"}]]}]}],["$","section",null,{"className":"pb-16","children":["$","$L20",null,{"articles":[{"id":"walmart-nw-ark-2025","slug":"walmart-nw-ark-2025","title":"Walmart Championship Preview as Race to CME Heats Up","author":"George Hack","authorId":"george-hack","date":"2025-09-17","category":"Tournament Preview","excerpt":"The LPGA Tour heads to Arkansas for the 19th Walmart NW Arkansas Championship at Pinnacle Country Club.
