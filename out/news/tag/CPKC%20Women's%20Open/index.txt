26:Tfd8,This wasn't a Sunday stroll along the river for Brooke Henderson. It was a duel. A final round that felt less like stroke play and more like match play, where every birdie and every answer from Minjee Lee hung heavy in the air. By the time Henderson rolled in her final putt and lifted the trophy, the Canadian galleries had their dream ending -- their star back on top, on home soil, for the first time in more than two years.

Henderson's closing 4-under 67 at Mississaugua pushed her to 15 under, one shot clear of Lee's 68. The win marked her second CPKC Women's Open title, her 14th career victory on the LPGA Tour, and an emphatic end to a drought that had stretched across 64 starts.

"This week was beyond special," Henderson said, standing behind the 18th green. "To be able to win my national open again, in front of these crowds… it feels surreal."

**A Sunday Match Play**

The day began with Henderson and Lee tied at 11 under, three clear of the field. The crowd sensed it early: this was no longer a four-day tournament but a head-to-head contest between Canada's brightest star and one of the game's most polished champions.

The momentum swung like a pendulum. At the par-5 13th, Henderson nearly eagled but settled for birdie. Lee answered, rolling in her own. On the very next hole, the pivotal par-3 14th, Henderson made a pure 6-foot birdie putt for a one-stroke lead.

Then came a behind the netter. On the 17th, with the gallery encircling the short par-4, Lee drained a 13-footer for birdie. The roar barely settled before Henderson stepped up and buried her own from 12 feet. Birdie for birdie.

Lee smiled. Henderson clenched her fist. The match ever so tilted Henderson's way. She carried that one-stroke edge to the house.

"I kind of got outplayed," Lee admitted, gracious in defeat. "I did my job. But Brooke was just a little better today."

**A Career Marker**

For Henderson, 27, the victory carries more weight than just number 14 on her career tally. This was her first title since the Diamond Resorts Tournament of Champions in January 2023, and it arrived after months of doubt, struggle, and slipping down the world rankings.

She is projected to leap back into the top 30 in the Race to CME Globe, securing her spot in the season-ending CME Group Tour Championship. More importantly, she reminded herself -- and everyone else -- what a locked-in Brooke Henderson looks like.

When she first won this championship in 2018 at Wascana, she became the first Canadian in 45 years to lift the national title. To do it again, seven years later, in front of her home fans felt like the circle closing once more.

"I thought I might cry, honestly," Henderson said. "It's just been so long. I felt like this week was meant to be."

To our Canadian friends across the Great Lakes, to the thunderous galleries, to those filling sports bars from coast to coast, and to the entire Canadian golf community -- bravo for the way you carried Henderson. Even her peers seemed to understand the weight of the moment. She had fought through doubts and close calls, only to find her game again when the stage demanded it. And so, a Canadian classic was written.

## Round 4 Competition Highlights

**Henderson's** birdie on 14 gave her the solo lead — and she never gave it back.

**Minjee Lee** holed a birdie from 13 feet only for Henderson to answer immediately with her own from 12.

**The galleries around Henderson were massive**, the kind of Canadian following that was Ryder Cup-sized at times.

**Henderson's** up-and-downs on 15 and 16 held her lead steady in the tightest stretch of the round.

Fifteen-year-old phenom **Aphrodite Deng** tied for 20th at 4 under, capping a remarkable week.

**Mao Saigo** finished third at 11 under.

**Akie Iwai**, who led after two rounds, settled for fourth.

## Shout Out

**Canada's** steadfast support for its sports stars was nothing short of inspiring.

## Gear Notes

Henderson sealed the win playing a TaylorMade TP5x golf ball.27:T1558,Henderson lit up the third round with a 6-under 65, capped by the kind of closing stretch that can tilt a tournament and change the mood of an entire gallery. She birdied the 15th and 16th, holed out from the greenside bunker on the short par-4 17th to ignite the crowd, and finished with a par on 18. Her father and longtime coach, Dave Henderson, even broke his usual stoicism with a rare celebration, pumping his arms as if even he couldn't hold back the noise. The finish pushed her to 11-under and tied with Minjee Lee for the lead.

The bunker shot on 17 was the day's defining moment, a piece of theater. Mississaugua's par-4 seventeenth doesn't look like much on the card, but standing on it in the heat of battle is something different. A big drive leaves only a wedge, and Henderson's left her approach in the front bunker, a tricky lie staring her down with the tournament hanging in the air. What came next was the kind of shot you remember years later: the crisp strike, the thump of sand, and the ball climbing out of the lip before landing soft and tracking straight into the hole. The roar sounded less like a golf clap and more like an arena crowd. Henderson called her round an "A" and admitted she was actually happy to see the ball end up in the sand, knowing she had the chance to pull something off.

She hasn't won since January 2023 or posted a top-10 this season, but her record is daunting: eight victories in her last 11 tries when holding at least a share of the lead heading into Sunday. History may not repeat, but it often rhymes, and Henderson has the kind of winning muscle memory that can carry her across a finish line.

Lee nearly matched Henderson with a 66, a round just as brilliant but built differently-- the kind of steady method she's made a career on. Two eagles, a birdie chip-in, and a deft par save at 18 filled her card. The Australian, who won the KPMG Women's PGA Championship in June, is chasing her 12th LPGA title and her second of the year. Her career has never been about flash, though the numbers say she belongs among the elite: two majors, a slew of wins across three continents, and a knack for playing her best when the courses demand discipline. After years of frustration with the putter, she's turned the switch to the long model into one of the season's most dangerous weapons. When the stroke is rolling, she doesn't just score; she squeezes the air out of the leaderboard.

Three shots back, world No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul sits tied for third with Japan's Akie Iwai. Thitikul's steady 69 kept her in the mix, a quiet round that looked routine on the card but was anything but simple on a course where thick rough and uneven lies lurk at every corner. She carries herself like someone twice her age -- patient, precise, and never hurried -- which makes sense for a player who has spent most of her teenage years ranked inside the world's top five. Iwai, meanwhile, struggled early with 3 bogeys to start her round but steadied herself, and her firepower is the kind that can heat up quickly. Both players loom as serious Sunday dangers.

Canadian amateur Aphrodite Deng shot 68 to reach 6-under, tied for seventh. She needed only 26 putts and continues to showcase a lethal wedge game. A top-12 finish would mark the best LPGA result by an amateur this season, adding another layer of intrigue to an already Canadian-heavy storyline. It isn't just Henderson carrying The Maple Leaf.

For Henderson, the opportunity is singular. A 13-time winner, she's looking to become the first Canadian to win her national open twice since 1914. Winning again, on home soil, would put her in rarefied company and cement her as the most accomplished Canadian player of any era.

The galleries will be hers on Sunday, and she knows it. "Winning in 2018 was a huge career highlight," she said. "To be in this position again is really, really cool. I just hope to get a fast start, make birdies, and get the crowd on my side."

The CPKC Women's Open has grown into something larger than a golf tournament. It carries identity, memory, and emotion—for the fans who fill the ropes as much as for the players inside them. Henderson and Lee have staged a duel worthy of the spotlight, with world No. 1 Thitikul and a fearless amateur close enough to change the script. Whether it finishes in maple-leaf triumph or an Australian claim, Mississaugua is set to deliver a champion in major fashion.

## Round 3 Competition Highlights

**Brooke Henderson** shot 6-under 65, including a holed bunker shot for eagle on 17.

**Minjee Lee** carded a 66 with two eagles (12 and 17) and a par-saving chip-in at 18.

**Jeeno Thitikul** three shots back at 8-under after a steady 69. She recorded five birdies.

**Akie Iwai** dropped to a 72 on Saturday but tied for third at 8-under.

**Aphrodite Deng** needed just 26 putts, converting nearly every look inside 15 feet.

**Leona Maguire** nearly aced the par-3 6th hole.

**Yu Liu** shot a 67 on Saturday to climb into contention at 7-under.

**Pajaree Anannarukarn** is not in contention but leads the Audi Precision Award with 43 greens in regulation.

## Gear Notes

[TaylorMade Qi35 Driver](https://www.taylormadegolf.com/Qi35-Driver/DW-TC370.html?lang=en_US).28:Tea8,At Mississaugua, round two delivered shifts, scares, and cheers as players fought for weekend ground. Mississaugua’s first crack at hosting the CPKC Women’s Open showed off quick greens, heavy rough, and a layout built that demanded patience while keeping eagles and birdies hard-earned.

Akie Iwai, fresh off her breakthrough in Portland, continued her strong play and aggressive style. It occasionally cost her. Even so, she closed the day with a steady 2-under 69 to build a three-shot cushion at 9-under, though afterward she admitted to leaving too many birdie chances on the table.

Leona Maguire, one of the most consistent drivers on tour, delivered several long-range putts to stay in contention despite battling with the flatstick at shorter range. Australia’s Minjee Lee and world No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul joined Maguire in the chasing pack at 6-under.

And then there was Brooke Henderson. Even the winningest golfer in Canadian history can still look like she’s cramming for the exam, and Friday was a case study. Henderson, cheered on by the largest gallery of the day, turned in a 5-under 66 that vaulted her 33 spots up the board and away from the cut line that had been uncomfortably close. “I just wanted to get away from the cut line as fast as I could,” she said afterward, and did so with the casual urgency of someone checking their rearview mirror, then stomping on the gas. Any time Henderson’s name creeps near the top of the board on Canadian soil, the energy follows—loud, expectant, and full of possibility.

Stacy Lewis showed her veteran poise with a clever recovery from a penalty area to save par, while Sweden’s Linnea Ström nearly jarred an approach at 17. Young Canadian amateur Aphrodite Deng and Québec’s Maude-Aimée Leblanc brought local flavor to the pairings. Fifteen-year-old Deng cooled off after her electric opening round but still held her ground at 3-under, another reminder that the country's future talent isn't stuck on the bench or skating the second line anymore; she's already teeing it up under the spotlight.

For the weekend, the greens are smooth enough to make a Zamboni driver smile. Iwai holds the lead, Henderson is charging, and the leaderboard is the kind of Saturday puzzle that makes a national championship worth following. With narrow margins, a raucous crowd, veterans holding steady, and young guns pressing, the CPKC Women’s Open heads into the final 36 holes wide open and ready for a thrilling finish.

## Round 2 Competition Highlights

**Akie Iwai** shot a 2-under 69 to take a three-stroke lead at 9-under par.

Canadian fan favorite **Brooke Henderson** made a massive leap up the leaderboard with a 5-under 66, moving 33 spots away from the cut line.

**Maude-Aimée Leblanc**, the Quebec native, who has battled injuries, made a clutch putt, demonstrating the progress she's made.

**Leona Maguire, Minjee Lee, and Jeeno Thitikul** are all tied for second at 6-under, setting up a thrilling final 36 holes.

**Stacy Lewis** saved par with a crafty shot from a penalty area, earning one of the loudest applauses of the day.

**Linnea Ström** nearly holed out at 17, showcasing sharp iron play.

**Yan Liu** posted a four-under round with excellent pace on the greens, moving up the leaderboard.

## Shout Out

To Course Superintendent **Jon Smith** and his crew. They’ve crafted a course so pristine and playable, it continues to impress.

**The Inclinator:** Reminiscent of a mining cart that ferries players from the 15th green to the 16th tee. It isn't in use for the tournament, but what an incredible and unique feature!

## Gear Notes

**Brooke Henderson’s driver** is so hot it might set off the sprinklers.29:T1308,The first round of the CPKC Women's Open gave us a leaderboard that was equal parts expected and surprising. Familiar champions like Jin Young Ko and Nelly Korda went searching for form, Akie Iwai posted a flawless 64 to take the solo lead, and a 15-year-old Canadian amateur with an unshakable stare stole much of the spotlight.

Jin Young Ko--once unstoppable, now two years removed from her last win looked steady, carding 5 birdies, including the par 5s of 12 and 13. Showing the pinpoint iron play that earned her the world No. 1 spot in 2020, this is the same player who went bogey-free over 72 holes to claim this event in 2019--and she’s signaling she could do it again.

Nelly Korda, meanwhile, is still chasing her first victory of 2025 after piling up seven a year ago. Her round was a blend of sharp birdies and a rare stumble at the 175-yard par-3 third. Still, she exhibited the brilliance that makes her game so unmistakable--none better than a wedge from 81 yards that back-spun into easy scoring range. The mudball she faced at 11, the toughest hole of the day, was the kind of bad break that can throw off rhythm, but she salvaged enough to save par.

And then there's sponsor invitee Aphrodite Deng, the Canadian amateur who plays like she's seen this stage before. Just 15 years old and already a U.S. Girls' Junior champion, she led stretches of the day with poise beyond her years. She hit nearly every fairway, stuck approaches close, and even when she missed, her recovery shots carried quiet confidence. Whether it's adrenaline or just youth, Deng hasn't blinked. Six birdies and a first-round 66 have her sitting T2, making her Canadian debut a national storyline.

Megan Kang, 2023's CPKC winner in Vancouver, kept herself firmly in the mix with three birdies in four holes. Kang knows this golf course, knows the pressure, and still makes it look routine. Her controlled fades off the tee and steady putting kept her close to the leader.

Other names surfaced and impressed: Gaby Lopez, showing graceful touch, finished her round tied for second with 7 birdies; rookie Ina Yoon grinding out pars from thick Canadian rough; and Taiwan's Chien Peiyun carded a 68 thanks to her crisp ball striking.

The greens rolled pure--"smooth," one player said--rewarding aggressive iron play but punishing hesitation. Several players noted switching to firmer wedges this week to handle the tight and muddy fringes. Together, the field and Mississaugua produced exactly the kind of test you'd expect from an LPGA stage of this caliber.

## Round 1 Competition Highlights

**Jin Young Ko's** birdie run included a sharp seven-iron at 16 to set up her fourth birdie of the day, showing flashes of her 2019 Ontario form.

**Gaby Lopez** recorded six birdies in her final 10 holes, tying for the most birdies in the field on Thursday with seven.

**Nelly Korda** recovered from a shaky approach on 11 with a perfectly flighted 81-yard wedge at 12 that spun to four feet, keeping her in contention.

**Jeeno Thitikul** also at T2, shot six birdies over her last 10 holes, including back-to-back birdies on Nos. 3-4 and 9-10. It was her first start at the CPKC Women's Open since moving to Rolex No. 1.

**Aphrodite Deng**, the 15-year-old amateur, hit nearly every fairway and dropped just one bogey, holding her ground against seasoned winners and ended R1 as the lowest Canadian in the field.

**Megan Kang**, last year's champion, climbed the board with a burst of birdies on the back nine, demonstrating comfort and poise at Mississaugua.

**Soo Bin Joo** sits 7th at four under, citing improvements in mental game, swing, putting, and chipping for her solid round.

**Leona Maguire** sits T2 after a 66, posting six birdies against one bogey. She missed just one fairway, birdied it, and praised the smooth greens for giving herself plenty of scoring opportunities.

**Yuna Nishimura** electrified the gallery with a long birdie putt that rolled true, a reminder of her fearless putting stroke.

**Hae Ran Ryu** displayed precise iron play with aggressive wedge shots into tucked pins, earning multiple birdies.

**Lindy Duncan** clanged her approach off the flagstick at 16, striking the cup so sharply it dented the metal.

## Gear Notes

Nothing too major to note. A few players opted for stiffer-shafted wedges to better handle the thick, muddy fringes and rough around the course.2a:T17d0,The 51st CPKC Women's Open doesn't just look like a major, it feels like it. The field would pass for one in any corner of the golf world. 156 players are here, six of them sitting in the Rolex top 10, and every one chasing a slice of $2.75 million and the chance to carve their name on the open trophy.

**The Venue**

This year's Canadian Open takes place on the fairways of Mississaugua Golf & Country Club, a course that carries real gravitas. The Credit River winds through its valley, shaping a landscape at once pastoral and formidable. The greens and bunkers, refined by Donald Ross, still bear the original mark of George Cumming's design. And as the spotlight shines, Canada is poised to put its finest golf and hospitality on display for us. 

It is important to recognize that this course stands on the traditional lands of the [Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation](https://mncfn.ca/), whose history and connection to this traditional territory carries significance greater than the game played upon it.

**The Past in Play**

For some in the field, Mississaugua is not entirely new ground. In 2016, the club hosted the World Junior Girls Championship, where Yuka Saso hoisted the individual trophy while leading the Philippines to a team win. She's back now as a two-time U.S. Women's Open champion, looking to rediscover the magic of those fairways. Alongside her are Haeran Ryu, Maja Stark, and Esther Henseleit -- players who also walked these grounds in that juniors championship and now return as proven winners.

**Maple Leaf Standouts**

Brooke Henderson, the face of Canadian golf and a 13-time LPGA Tour winner, is in the field and hot off a T23 finish in Portland. Henderson's 2018 triumph at this championship remains one of the defining moments in Canadian sport, ending a 45-year drought and being the first national win since Jocelyne Bourassa in 1973. She leads a group of Canadians in the field, each chasing that same dream of lifting their country's championship trophy on home soil (maybe sneaking in a few celebratory Tim Hortons Timbiebs for good measure).

**The World's Best Are Back**

[Newly crowned No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul](https://www.birdiebriefing.com/news/jeeno-thitikul-quiet-stride/) makes her first start since climbing past Nelly Korda in the rankings. Korda, meanwhile, is still searching for her first win of 2025 despite a season full of close calls. Lydia Ko, a three-time winner of the Canadian Open, returns with the kind of experience that makes her dangerous. And rising star Lottie Woad, riding wins in Ireland and Scotland, adds another layer of intrigue to an already loaded entry list.

**Coughlin Returns**

[At Earl Grey Golf Club](https://earlgreygolfclub.com/) in Calgary last year, Lauren Coughlin finally cracked through with her first LPGA victory at this very event. That win ignited a streak that carried her to a second title at Dundonald and a victorious debut in the Solheim Cup. Now, back in Canada to defend, she brings momentum with her, a T7 finish last week in Portland.

**Sponsor Invitees**

The championship has also welcomed sponsor invites that ensure the next wave has its chance to shine. Ontario's Alena Sharp and Quebec's Maude-Aimée Leblanc are in the field, joined by rising amateurs like Anna Davis, Carla Bernat Escuder, and U.S. Women's Amateur champion Megha Ganne.

**Sustainable Approach**

Golf Canada is raising the bar on sustainability at the Open, aiming to make the tournament zero-waste and carbon-neutral. Partnering with the Green Event Ninjas, the event has already diverted 75% of waste, recycled thousands of kilograms of material, and eliminated nearly 68,000 single-use water bottles. With fans encouraged to bike, carpool, and engage in eco-friendly practices, the Open is setting a new standard for environmental responsibility.
