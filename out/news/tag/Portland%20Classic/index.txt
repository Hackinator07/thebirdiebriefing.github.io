27:Tf83,Akie Iwai's first win had been circling all season, tapping her shoulder in Thailand, wagging its finger in Los Angeles. Then she watched her twin sister, Chisato, sip champagne in Mexico while she smiled through the twinge of being the other half of the story. On Sunday in Portland, she finally got to write her own ending.

The 23-year-old rookie from Saitama closed with a bogey-free 66 to win The Standard Portland Classic by four, finishing at 24-under. Six birdies and no errors -- the kind of round players dream about but rarely manage when it matters most. She birdied Nos. 5 and 6 to settle herself, then went about the back nine like a painter, deliberate and precise in her strokes. She sealed the victory with birdies on 17 and 18, the last an 18-footer that rolled in with the composure of a player who had already made up her mind about the outcome.

That's when sister Chisato came running across the green, champagne bottle in hand. If the LPGA is still searching for its next great sibling storyline, it found it in that moment -- a younger sister by sixty seconds dousing her twin in fizzy, French affirmation.

The rest of the field deserves their ink. American Gurleen Kaur posted her career-best finish, runner-up at 20-under, and appeared like a player eager to keep going if only there had been a fifth round to play. Linn Grant shared third with Chisato, and Grace Kim stayed in the conversation at 18-under. Even Oregon amateur Kiara Romero made noise with a 64 and a tie for seventh, giving the local Ducks faithful a glimpse of the future. But in truth, the week belonged to Akie.

Her win folds neatly into a larger Japanese surge on tour this year. She became the fifth from her country to win in 2025, joining Chisato, Rio Takeda, Mao Saigo, and British Open champion Miyu Yamashita. It feels less like coincidence and more like a movement, each name sharpening the edge of Japanese golf. And by winning, Akie and Chisato joined a rare sorority -- sisters etched into LPGA history alongside the Kordas, the Jutanugarns, and the Sorenstams.

What will linger from this Sunday, though, isn't the data. It's the image of Akie exhaling on the 72nd green, her mother in tears nearby, the pressure of all those close calls finally lifting.

And so, among the verdure of Portland's towering trees and fairways, Akie Iwai hoisted her first LPGA trophy, champagne-soaked and smiling. She departed Columbia Edgewater no longer the twin giving chase, but the one who had at last arrived.

## Final Round Competition Highlights

**Grace Kim** two back entering the day, led the field in putting despite a couple of three-putts this week; she rolled 3 key birdies on the back nine to finish in 5th with an 18 under 270

**Gurleen Kaur** bounced back from a slow start yesterday, birdieing the 7th, 9th, 10th, and 17th holes, with accurate wedge shots, bringing her within a shot of the lead several times.

**Chisato Iwai** already an LPGA winner; eagled multiple par fives to finish the day at a 64

**Linn Grant** delivered an impressive weekend with rounds of 66-71-65-67. Could she be next to capture a tournament victory? We certainly hope so.

**Aditi Ashok** finished strong, carding three late birdies to reach 17-under, highlighting a standout performance.

**Akie Iwai** sank crucial putts down the stretch, including a long one on the 18th, to secure her win of The Standard Portland Classic and join her sister Chisato as an LPGA champion.

## Shout Out

**Gurleen Kaur** comes in solo second. Exactly the kind of golf we want to see more of!

## Gear Notes

**Akie Iwai** captured The Standard Portland Classic [gaming the Z-STAR XV](https://us.dunlopsports.com/srixon/steady-dominance-products/z-star-xv-golf-balls/10360119.html), putting the ball back in the winner's circle. Srixon has had a dominant 2025 season, collecting three majors at the Chevron Championship, Amundi Evian, and AIG Women's Open.28:Tc70,If Akie Iwai hangs on, it'll be a tidy LPGA rookie story: first win, big smile, trophy hoisted. But Round 3 at The Standard Portland Classic proved golf isn't always that neat getting there and how little box scores capture the raw, aggressive play behind them. 

We'd be remiss if we didn't start with Akie Iwai's driver off the deck on 12. She absolutely smoked it -- wide left, steep enough to look like it was hunting for kindling -- and into the towering sequoias it went. Somehow, someway, the ball bounced back into play. What followed wasn't just a save; it was a birdie. What viewed like mayhem was, in fact, a show of artistry.

She stumbled early. A single bogey at 2. That was followed by playing five holes in five under. A 5 wood to 3 feet for eagle on 5, a trio of birdies coming fast. Her pièce de résistance: a 152 yard approach to a foot on the 18th closing her round at 64 and leaving her a steady 18 under 198.

Iwai kept it simple when asked later: "Rely on good tempo. No change (in approach). Aggressive. Aim to the pin." She capped it with a smirk and a cheeky "Pew pew," sharp and focused. Marie and I spun and laughed.

Hot on her trail? Grace Kim. Her 17th hole provided the most important and dramatic incident after her tee shot landed in a nasty lie in the left rough by a sprinkler box. Relief? Denied. The crowd held its breath as she studied the shot, gripped her 7-iron, and ripped it anyway.

In her head and said afterwards: "Oh, please get through the rough." There was a glimmer of hope as the ball landed just right of the green, kicked off the slope, and rolled in for a surreal eagle. An amazing performance sprinkled with a bit of luck.

Other performances include Swede Linn Grant who stayed in contention at 14 under after a 65, saying she wasn't "happy," but was embracing what the round would bring and having fun along the way. 

Gurleen Kaur (70) and Aditi Ashok (65) are just behind, at 13 and 12 under respectively.

Portland's vibe for Round 4? Sharp, fearless, and electric. Iwai's sticking to her approach, attacking pins with purpose and confidence. The story isn't done yet -- just set up, waiting for the final act.

## Round 3 Competition Highlights

**Cassie Porter** is having a strong rookie season, notching eight birdies and two bogeys while chasing the leaders.

**Aditi Ashok** had a clean card for a 65.

**Linn Grant** stayed in contention at 14 under with a 65 which included an eagle on 7

**Gurleen Kaur** clawed back from a double bogey at the first, and later eagled 7 proving she can fight in contention despite first time nerves.

## Shout Out

**Haeran Ryu** aced the Toyota Hole-in-One 16th, banking $50,000 toward a new Toyota -- might we suggest a GR Corolla? Worth noting, that's $80,000 shy of what the men are offered at the BMW Championship.

## Gear Notes

**Akie Iwai** pulling up with the [2024 Yonex EZONE GT Type S Driver in Turquoise Blue](https://store.shopping.yahoo.co.jp/bright1ststage/2024042601v.html?sc_i=shopping-pc-web-result-item-rsltlst-img), matched to her [Master Bunny Edition top](https://www.masterbunnyedition.net/collection/2025su/index.html).29:T103c,Round 2 of the Standard Portland Classic brought cooler conditions and a livelier breeze to Columbia Edgewater. Gray skies hung overhead as the wind swirled the trees and swept across the ryegrass and fescue of the roughs. Still, the conditions favored those with pinpoint approach shots and steady, disciplined play.

Jeongeun Lee5 found her rhythm in a big way, rattling off five birdies in a row from holes 5 through 9. She has been cashing checks with her wedges through two rounds, trusting the sharp end of the bag to do the talking. She’s found 30 of 36 greens, and from that sweet spot of 100 to 125 yards, she’s been carving darts -- twelve swings averaging just 17 and a half feet from the pin! That’s more than five feet better than the tour’s norm, the kind of margin that helps explain why Korea keeps producing world-beaters and why Lee5 looks perfectly comfortable on the course. 

Also making moves was Canada's Savannah Grewal, posting a 67 on the day and making her tied for 8th at -8. Thailand's Jaravee Boonchant (WR 374) stole the spotlight with seven birdies on her way to an impressive 65. 

Grace Kim kept herself in the hunt with some clutch up-and-downs, including a delicate chip from the water's edge on 10 and a textbook bunker escape on 14. Through two rounds she also carried not a simple stick of steel, but a precision putter, the ball chasing her will across the greens. More than a hundred feet of putts have fallen for her each day, and nine times the ball has traveled ten feet or more to the hole. That momentum carried her to -11, locking in a two-way tie for second place. And now, thanks to a 7-under bet, her physical therapist is officially donning a yellow tutu at the [International Crown](https://crown.lpga.com/) -- with any luck [Skippy will be in tow](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMERtb5Npqq/) for good measure!

As Round 2 concludes, Jeongeun Lee5 holds solo first, with Gurleen Kaur and Grace Kim tied for second. A three-way tie for third includes Pajaree Anannarukarn, Ashleigh Buhai, and Akie Iwai, while Aline Krauter, Amelia Lewis, Yealimi Noh, and Miranda Wang share fourth place.

## Round 2 Competition Highlights

**Jeongeun Lee5** surged to the top with a blistering stretch of five straight birdies, reaching 12-under and leading by two shots at one stage. She followed her hot streak with a key par save at the par-5 10th.

**Gurleen Kaur** posted 12 pars and birdies for a 68, tying her with Grace Kim for second place.  

**Stacy Lewis** recovered from a short missed birdie on 10 with birdies at 12, 14, and 16 displaying some excellent putting tempo.

**Linn Grant** had a streaky day, making important par saves but struggling at times with the putter including a bogey on 12.

**Gigi Stoll**, a hometown player from Oregon, had family following and nearly holed a chip early in her round, ultimately finishing the day with a 70.

**Amelia Lewis (179th CME)** battled to make the most of her limited LPGA status, executing a key bunker save under pressure.

**Gabby Ruffels** played with her brother Ryan on the bag, delivering a strong approach into 18 in her bid to contend.

**Rose Zhang and Xiaowen Yin** are tied for 27th after matching rounds of 64, with Zhang making a standout eagle on the par-4 ninth.

**Julia Lopez Ramirez** turned in a masterclass in par saves, carding 16 of them on the day.

## Shout Out

**Juli Inkster**, affectionately dubbed the "least youthful" player in the field by cherished commentator Grant Boone, closed the day at +2 and sits at -1 overall. -- not enough to make the cut and stay in contention for the win but Juli, we love you. Absolute boss aura.

**Kiara Romero (Amat)**, the Oregon Duck and world No. 766, eagled the par-5 12th and closed the day at 8-under, tied for sixth. Eyes on you, go get it.

**Aditi Ashok** marked India's Independence Day with precise approach shots to the center of the greens, opting for a steady, conservative strategy.

## Gear Notes

**Ashley Buhai** switched to a new putter after her South Africa coaching session, rolling in five birdies to finish 4-under.2a:T1119,Columbia Edgewater opened cool and calm on day one, with barely a hint of wind – perfect conditions for what felt like a spring-loaded leaderboard. Even with limited broadcast coverage, every time you glanced away, someone else was making a move. The air had a crispness the previous days lacked, forcing players to adjust and keeping them sharp throughout the round. The tree-lined fairways delighted some, while others felt boxed in, more looking down a narrow bowling lane. The greens rolled true and fast, a solid 12 on the stimp according to some.

Brooke Henderson set the tone with a four-birdie streak right out of the gate. Wichanee Meechai fired off a birdie-eagle-birdie start that had the gallery whispering and the crows cawing. Chisato Iwai, blending in with her Oregon green top, finished at three under, highlighted by an impressive eagle on the 463-yard par-5 seventh.

American Gurleen Kaur posted up eight birdies, while China's Miranda Wang navigated around the towering trees to card a bogey-free round, saving par eleven times. Abacaya Yubol kept her card clean with twelve pars and no bogeys, finishing the day tied for fourth alongside Haeran Ryu. Jin Young Ko of South Korea delivered a commanding performance, carding a five-under-par round with 13 pars and five birdies.

In the afternoon wave, rookie Adéla Cernousek and fellow Frenchwoman Perrine Delacour made their presence felt, finishing at 8-under and 6-under, respectively.

So, at the end of Round 1 Adéla Cernousek rests alone atop the leaderboard at 8-under. A five-way logjam at 7-under sees Henderson, Kaur, Lee5, Park, and M. Wang all in the mix, while a tightly packed chase group -- including Buhai, Grant, Ryu, Yubol, and Delacour -- tied for seventh, keeps the tension high heading into Round 2.

## Round 1 Competition Highlights

**Brooke Henderson** stuck a solid third shot on the par-5 10th for birdie to start her round, added another on 11, and went a perfect four-for-four on birdies through 13.

**Adéla Cernousek**, the rookie from Antibes, France, showcased her technical, course management driven style to finish alone in first at 8-under including an eagle on 7.

**Caroline Masson's** 7-iron at the par-3 second was so pure she didn't even see it disappear. Hidden behind a bunker, the ball found the cup for her first ace of the year, sending a ripple of cheers across the gallery.

**Perrine Delacour**, currently ranked 118 in the world, had a phenomenal day posting 4 birdies on the front 9 and finishing tied for 7th.

**Rose Zhang**, hindered by injury and a stop-start schedule struggled early, including double bogeys on 10 and 13, never quite finding her rhythm.

**Wichanee Meechai** fired off a birdie-eagle-birdie start but finished even for the day.

**Lilia Vu** was working to regain the form that once took her to World No. 1. 16 pars and 1 birdie on the day to end even.

**Caroline Inglis** playing on her home course came close to recreating her past heroics at the 13th, setting up a short birdie putt and finishing at 2-under.

**Chisato Iwai**, blending in with her Oregon green top, finished at three under, highlighted by an impressive eagle on the 463-yard par-5 seventh.

**Jin Young Ko's** ball striking was sharp all day, producing a commanding five-under round built on 13 pars and five birdies.

**Lauren Coughlin** pushed her way to four-under with a strong putting performance and an aggressive approach off the tees.

**Yuka Saso** carded four birdies, but double bogeys on 9 and 11 knocked her back, leaving her at 6-over for the day.

**Abacaya Yubol** held a one-shot lead at one point and kept a spotless card with twelve pars and no bogeys, ending the day tied for 6th.

American **Gurleen Kaur** posted eight birdies.

**Gigi Stoll** stumbled with a triple bogey on the 426-yard par-4 third but recovered to shoot an even-par 72 for the round.

## Shout Out

Filipino golf fans have reason to be excited as **Dottie Ardina** posted a superb -3 for the day. Ardina looked incredibly sharp throughout her round, displaying a level of control and confidence that suggests her game may reach top form over the course of the weekend.

## Gear Notes

Brooke Henderson is playing with a new TaylorMade Spider putter, fitted with a [Garsen Quad Tour NT grip](https://garsengolf.com/).2b:T9f6,At Columbia Edgewater Country Club, the greens are ready as one of the LPGA Tour's enduring pillars returns under a new banner. [The Standard Insurance Company](https://www.standard.com/get-to-know-standard/newsroom/press-releases/standard-portland-classic-welcomes-top-women-golfers-aug-14-17-2025) has stepped in with a 3-year commitment as title sponsor for the longest-running non-major on the LPGA Tour, reaffirming tradition, evolution, and a celebration of women golf's.

Founded in 1972, this tournament is woven into the sport's fabric. From the team event era of the late '70s to its transformation into a 72-hole since 2013, it has crowned legends like Annika Sörenstam, Nancy Lopez, and Brooke Henderson, and raised over $18 million for children's charities in the Pacific Northwest.

Recent champions have written compelling chapter arcs: in 2024, Moriya Jutanugarn charged a final-round 66 to seize her third LPGA Tour win. In 2023, 19-year-old Chanettee Wannasaen, a Monday qualifier, erased nine straight missed cuts in her season and broke the course record with a –26 to claim her first LPGA win.

But the Portland Classic is more than a gallery of champions. It's a festival of community and engagement. This year, fans can look forward to a Les Schwab Tires Par-3 Tournament on August 16, where LPGA professionals mentor aspiring junior girls across the holes.

A Portland favorite, The Sports Bra, will have a pop-up bar on hole 15, complete with shaded seating perched above one of the tournament's pivotal holes. There is also the Umpqua Family Fun Zone with golf games, local food vendors, giveaways, and further charity programming through First Tee - Oregon.

It's business and beauty. Volunteers and values. As Amy Malagamba of The Standard notes, "The Classic is more than a golf tournament -- it's a celebration of excellence, perseverance and community."

That spirit, like the greens of Columbia Edgewater, remains timeless.

[Tickets](https://www.portlandclassic.com/ticket-information) for The Standard Portland Classic are on sale now, starting from $25. Fans seeking a closer vantage can opt for upgraded passes with VIP seating inside the Champions Club, while a special combo package pairs tournament access with a ticket to the Portland Thorns FC match on August 10.
