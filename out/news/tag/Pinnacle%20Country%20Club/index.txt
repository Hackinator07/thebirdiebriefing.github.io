Overnight storms turned Pinnacle Country Club into a swamp (with more between Friday and Saturday), leaving the LPGA with no choice but to freeze the leaderboard. Japan’s Minami Katsu and American Sarah Schmelzel both carded 63s to finish at eight under.

Somi Lee, one of Korea's top players, had opened with a commendable 64—good enough to sit just one shot back of Sarah Schmelzel and Japan's Minami Katsu. She, like everyone else, would not get another swing that counted.

We saw all 144 players complete the first round, with a few slipping out early Saturday morning to start Round 2 before the weather made it obvious there would be no full tournament. By Sunday morning, after meetings and a review of the radar that offered no hope, the LPGA called it: the event was unofficial, no CME Globe points would be awarded, and there would be just 18 holes of golf.

![Conditions at Pinnacle Country Club](/optimized/weather-walmart.webp)

*Conditions at Pinnacle Country Club*

It is important to highlight that Walmart and P&G kept it classy with the $2 million purse intact. Instead of cutting it in half (which they were entitled to do), they paid out the full sum. Here's how that broke down for players:

•	$1.5 million went to the top 65 and ties, based on Round 1 scores.

•	The remaining $500,000 was split evenly, putting $3,500 in every player's pocket, even those who had a struggle through Friday.

It was a gesture that reminded the field that this tournament, which will mark its 20th anniversary in 2026, has respect for the players' work, expenses, and commitment to the game.

This event also marked the retirement of Stacy Lewis. The Arkansas native chose to end her career where it began. The rain might have shortened the golf, but it made for a fitting moment for Lewis to end her professional career under familiar skies.

## The Points Damage 

The biggest losers here were those chasing points. Carlota Ciganda (T3), Leona Maguire (T4), and Lilia Vu (T3) all walked away empty-handed in the CME Globe race, their efforts dissolved by weather. Lilia's crisp opening round could have been the start of a late season charge rather than another "what if" on the 2025 ledger.

## Shout Outs

To **Walmart and P&G** for keeping the total purse for the tournament and distributing it to entrants.21:T10b7,Fall golf has arrived, and with it, the LPGA Tour is in its home stretch for 2025. Just eight regular-season events and a stint through Asia remain before the [CME Group Tour Championship](https://www.cmegrouptourchampionship.com/). That means playing opportunities and CME points are becoming scarce. The great news is the 19th edition of the Walmart NW Arkansas Championship offers players a chance at a $3 million purse and 500 CME points (for the winner) over just 54 holes! 

**The Venue**

Since 2007 Pinnacle Country Club has played host to the championship. Once farmland in the hills of Rogers, it was transformed into a private club in 1990 with help from architect Don Sechrest and PGA player Bruce Lietzke. Reimagined by Randy Heckenkemper in 2009, Pinnacle has become one of the LPGA Tour's most reliable stages. It has wide fairways and from video reviews it seems to invite aggressive play. The real wild card for 2025 is the rain in the forecast which could cause delays, soft spots, and bumpy lies. Don't be surprised if the scores run higher than what we've seen in recent years. *You can hit the new Course Info tab in the scorecard on our website for all the details, but here's the quick version: it's a par 71 playing 6,438 yards. The Aon Risk Reward hole is the 14th -- a 549-yard par 5 that doglegs left and makes players consider clubs off the tee and plan for the sloped fairway and green.*

**Play on Playa(s)**

For the first time since 2022, Nelly Korda returns to Pinnacle. She missed the cut in her last trip but comes in on form, fresh off a T5 in Cincinnati.

World No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul, the 2022 champion, is sitting out this week, opening the door for someone else to grab momentum heading into the fall. Perhaps this is for the best so she can mentally regroup after her loss at Queen City to Charley Hull.

Reigning U.S. Women's Open champion Maja Stark is back after a T5 in Cincinnati. It was her best result since winning her major at Erin Hills. Look to see if she can keep the momentum rolling.

Rookies Miyu Yamashita and Lottie Woad, two of the season's brightest stories, will be in contention. Both finished inside the top five last week and will be making their Pinnacle debuts.

Past champions Haeran Ryu (2023), Nasa Hataoka (2021, 2018), and Stacy Lewis (2014, 2007) are also in the mix. Hataoka comes in with back-to-back top 10s and a track record of strong play on this course. As I type this I think she may have a go at winning here again this year.

**Sponsor Invitees**

Sponsor invites in the field are Maria Marin and Maria Fassi.

**Tickets, Sushi, Viewing Decks, and Parking**

General admission is $10 per day or $25 for the week, with free admission for kids 17 and under. The [BITE Experience ($50 daily) showcases local restaurants and culture. Looking over the menu it spans from steak, to sushi, to fried chicken, even a charcuterie & wine bar!](https://bitenwa.com/tickets?utm_source=chatgpt.com) The host nation has the Choctaw Club ($75 daily) which offers upgraded hospitality overlooking the island green at 15.

Fans can also enjoy free public viewing decks, affordable concessions at Tyson Cafes, and the lively "Gatorade Loudest Hole on Tour" at 17—where traditional golf etiquette gets put on hold. Double Waterhazards, anyone?

General parking Tuesday through Thursday is at the Rogers Convention Center [(3303 S Pinnacle Hills Pkwy)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ktFmZqnciiAc8oDD9), with shuttles running straight to the main admissions entrance at Pinnacle Country Club.

Friday through Sunday, general parking moves to the lot behind the Walmart Neighborhood Market off Exit 83 [(4501 S Pinnacle Hills Pkwy)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mqjdKuE469jzahFE7), where shuttles will also take fans directly to the main entrance.

*Note: Reddit user u/gorkatron had excellent feedback here, pointing out that while most fans focus on the race to the CME and the top 60, the battles for top 80 (priority status for next season) and top 100 (keeping your LPGA card without Q school) are just as crucial. Most players chasing those spots only have three more opportunities to earn points: this event, The Lotte Championship, and The ANNIKA, with the Asian events being limited-field.*13:[["$","$L1d",null,{"id":"news-list-json-ld","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$1e"}}],["$","div",null,{"className":"bg-white min-h-screen","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-8","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-col lg:flex-row gap-8","children":[["$","main",null,{"className":"flex-1 max-w-4xl","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-center gap-4","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 leading-tight tracking-tight","children":"Pinnacle%20Country%20Club"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex-1 h-px bg-gray-300"}]]}]}],["$","section",null,{"className":"pb-16","children":["$","$L1f",null,{"articles":[{"id":"walmart-nw-ark-r1-2025","slug":"walmart-nw-ark-r1-2025","title":"Minami Katsu and Sarah Schmelzel Top Truncated, Unofficial Walmart NW Arkansas Championship","author":"George Hack","authorId":"george-hack","date":"2025-09-23","category":"Tournament Golf","excerpt":"If there's one silver lining, it's how Walmart and P&G handled the tournament.
