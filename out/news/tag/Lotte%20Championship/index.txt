The 22-year-old from South Korea, competing on a sponsor exemption, closed with a 5-under 67 at Hoakalei Country Club to finish 17-under and win the Lotte Championship by one shot over Hyo Joo Kim.

Hwang began the day four shots behind but closed with five birdies in her final six holes, including the last four, to claim her first LPGA title. The KLPGA member becomes the 26th different winner in 25 LPGA events this season, tying the record for most unique champions in a single year.

Each of the top players on the leaderboard went into Saturday's round with an entirely different attitude. Minami Katsu, who had been able to press during the Arkansas Championship, wanted to take the step from contender to winner. She birdied the first hole, saved par from a bunker on the second, and chipped in on the sixth to reach 15-under. Hyo Joo Kim was putting the ball better than anyone with birdies on holes five, six, and seven, taking a share of the lead by the turn. Kim then extended her advantage with a long birdie putt from off the green on the par-4 15th, moving to 16-under and maintaining control as the wind picked up late in the round.

World No. 2 Nelly Korda made an early back-nine push with a near hole-out on the 10th and a birdie on 11 to reach 15-under, but missed birdie chances on 13 and 17, and a bogey on 16 left her tied for fourth at 14-under after a final-round 69. It marked her sixth top-five finish of the season but continued her winless streak in 2025.

As the leaders made the turn, Hwang was quietly building momentum. After birdies on 13 and 15, she pulled within one of Kim. When Kim and Katsu both bogeyed the par-3 17th, Hwang's birdie on the par-5 18th from the group ahead moved her to 17-under, giving her the outright lead. Kim needed an eagle on 18 to force a playoff but settled for a birdie, finishing one back at 16-under after a 68. Katsu closed with 69 to finish third at 15-under.

Hwang's win came after rounds of 67-62-75-67. Her 62 on Thursday tied the tournament's 18-hole scoring record and set up the opportunity she capitalized on over the weekend. It was her third start at the Lotte Championship and sixth overall on the LPGA Tour.

"I focused on my play, one shot at a time," Hwang said through a translator. "It's an honor to play with the strong players on the LPGA Tour and to win in a tournament sponsored by Lotte."

The victory earned Hwang $450,000 and the option to take immediate LPGA membership or defer it until 2026. She chose to defer.

Kim, who won the Lotte in 2022, finished runner-up for the second time this season. Katsu's third-place finish was her best result of the year. Behind them, Korda, Iwai, Peiyun, and Provasnik tied for fourth.

The LPGA Tour now moves to Asia for the five-event fall swing, beginning with the Buick LPGA Shanghai at Qizhong Garden Golf Club starting October 9th.

## Round 4 Competition Highlights

**Youmin Hwang (1st, 17-under)** A final-round 67 with five birdies on last six holes (13, 15–18); 11/14 fairways, 11/18 greens, 23 putts; tied for most birdies (21); KLPGA member on sponsor invite, now eligible for LPGA membership.

**Hyo Joo Kim (2nd, 16-under)** A final-round 68 with 7 birdies, 3 bogeys; 10/14 fairways, 11/18 greens, 25 putts; tied for fewest putts (108) and most birdies (21) in week; 2022 LOTTE Champion.

**Minami Katsu (3rd)** A final-round 69 with six birdies, three bogeys; 11/14 fairways, 12/18 greens, 27 putts; tied for most birdies in week (21).

**Stacy Lewis (T32)** A final-round 70 (2-under) in full-time LPGA career.

## Shout Out

**The coverage of Round 4 from the Golf Channel** deserves high praise. The simultaneous birdie putt feeds in picture-in-picture, the behind-the-ball putt cameras, and the rapid, seamless tracking of all the leaders felt fresh, special, and truly impressive. This is the kind of coverage we want to see more of. It was engaging and well executed.

## Gear Notes

Nothing of major note from round 4.21:Td6b,The LPGA Tour makes its annual stop in Hawaii this week for the 13th playing of the LOTTE Championship, one of just seven official events left on the 2025 schedule. 

After the Walmart NW Arkansas Championship was shortened to 18 holes and declared unofficial, this week's event in Ewa Beach has added importance. Players chasing season-long awards or fighting for one of the last few spots in the year's final events will be practiced and ready to take on the challenges ahead. After being held at [Ko Olina Golf Course](https://www.koolinagolf.com/) from 2012 to 2021, the tournament returns for its fourth year at Hoakalei.

*Note: With new feature being added almost weekly, keep up with the tournament using our Scorecard widget, where you’ll find live scores and round updates. [Round 1 and Round 2 tee times](https://www.birdiebriefing.com/tee-times/) are also easy to pull up—whether you’re on your mobile or at your computer—right here on our site.*

**The Course**

Hoakalei Country Club was designed by Ernie Els and opened in 2019. For this week's event the course stretches 6,536 to 6,566 yards depending on the source.

Nine water features shape the routing, with water coming into play on 13 of 18 holes, turning straightforward shots into ones of some precision. 112 bunkers are also positioned around the course, which can make or break a round.

There is also the unpredictability of trade winds here. Depending on the breeze, the course can play entirely differently from one day to the next, something the players will be keeping in mind this week as they play the tournament.

**The Players**

Charley Hull returns from a short break after her win in Cincinnati and will make her first start in Hawaii since 2019. Sarah Schmelzel and Nasa Hataoka, who both opened with low numbers in Arkansas, will try to carry that form into Hoakalei. Jennifer Kupcho, winner of the ShopRite LPGA Classic earlier this season, also arrives with momentum after a top-five in Cincinnati and a 65 in her lone round in Arkansas.

Nelly Korda is back, making her first start in Hawaii since her T2 finish in 2021. She enters the week ranked second in scoring average (69.78) behind Jeeno Thitikul, who is notably absent, giving Korda a chance to make up ground in the Player of the Year race.

A Lim Kim returns to defend her 2024 title, where she closed with a 68 to edge Nataliya Guseva by two. It was the second of her three career wins.

**Past Champions in the Field**

Hyo Joo Kim, the 2022 winner, is back and looking for her second title of the season after taking the Ford Championship earlier this year. Brooke Henderson, a two-time LOTTE champion (2018, 2019), is also in the field and fresh off a T15 at the FM Championship.

**Tickets and Details**

The LOTTE Championship begins Wednesday evening, October 1, with coverage each night from 6 to 9 p.m. CT on Golf Channel. The $3 million purse will be split among the 120-player field featuring 21 of the top 50 players in the Rolex Rankings.

Daily tickets start at $34 for general admission and $154 for Champions Club. Weekly passes start at $99 for general admission and $480 for Champions Club. Your Champions Club ticket gets you access to the tournament grounds plus a shared hospitality space overlooking the 18th at Hoakalei Country Club.
