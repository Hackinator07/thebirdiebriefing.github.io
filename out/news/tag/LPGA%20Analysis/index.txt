Her ball-striking has been sharp, her scoring average steady at 69.78, and if the putter will cooperate her luck could be about to change.

Part of what makes this week feel different is the field itself. Jeeno Thitikul, Lydia Ko, Minjee Lee, Angel Yin—they’re not here. That leaves the leaderboard a little more breathable, though Charley Hull and Miyu Yamashita remain capable of sneaky low rounds. The key for Korda will be keeping the bogeys under control, posting a low round early, and letting the other players chase her.

The course seems to favor her style: average hole length around 364 yards, visual lines that suit her precision, and enough risk-reward shots to reward patience. For Korda, it feels like the kind of week where four clean rounds could produce a victory.

If she threads it all together and gets the putter passable, the win feels like it could land in her lap. She just needs to move deliberately, stay efficient, and take measured approaches at the right moments.21:Ta4d,Let's put it plainly: Jeeno Thitikul is the best golfer in the world right now, and she did it by finishing tied for 30th at the AIG Women's Open.

We all saw it coming. Week after week, we kept asking the same thing: is this the one? And now here we are: the 22-year-old from Bangkok back on top of the Rolex Rankings. The moment came with a +1 at Porthcawl while Nelly Korda finished at +3, ending her impressive 71-week run at number one. No spotlight needed, just steady golf and the kind of composure typically reserved for Ariya Jutanugarn.

In this age where it sometimes feels we want immediate viral moments and the kind of fuss made for streaming services, Jeeno did this her way. She methodically chipped away at the rankings. You wouldn't have known it from her face Sunday, but there was triumph in her walk -- not a swagger, but that Ariya-esque stride, crossing dunes as if untouched by scores or poorly placed backboards that can hug a green. When asked about the ranking afterward, she said, "Sometimes, it's just about surviving the week."

When the week was over, did she celebrate? Of course. Maybe with an iced coffee, hold the ice, with her friend Ronnie Yin.

Jeeno's numbers support all this: eight top-10 finishes, runner-up at HSBC and Evian, and a win at the Mizuho Americas Open. Beyond the colorful grips, her iron game is sharp -- leading the tour with over 77% greens in regulation and averaging 4.6 birdies per round. She's a quietly relentless force among the best this season.

Let's not forget, this isn't Jeeno's first time. She was No. 1 in 2022, at just 19. That stint lasted two weeks -- roughly the same amount of time the PGA of America stays concerned with a player who punches up a historic country club's locker room. But she's back now, again without a major win. Older, calmer, and in absolutely no rush to appease anybody. If there's a deeper well of fortitude on tour, I haven't seen it.

Jeeno isn't here for the drama either, though some unintentionally [found her at Evian](https://ladieseuropeantour.com/blog/kim-claims-maiden-major-title-in-dramatic-playoff-at-the-amundi-evian-championship). What she is here for is the long game: contesting 20+ tournaments a season and quietly reclaiming the top spot from whoever assumed it was theirs. And when that major finally lands--and it will--don't expect a victory lap. Just a quiet nod, that trademark grin, and then she's off again, pin-seeking like nothing ever happened.

And the greater truth? Jeeno doesn't even need a major to have her place among the game's best. That's exactly what makes her so brilliant to watch.22:Tf90,By all accounts, Charley Hull should have collapsed again, physically or metaphorically. She said herself she came into the AIG Women's Open thinking she wouldn't make the cut. That's not just false modesty; she [collapsed at Evian](https://www.skratch.golf/news/news/charley-hull-evian-illness-update-womens-scottish-open), suffered a back injury that limited her practice time, and still showed up at Royal Porthcawl like she'd just fought off an adder with a long iron.

And yet, there she was on Sunday afternoon -- the crowd surging like the tide, the wind sweeping through with the rhythm of a Dylan Thomas verse, moody and irregular -- finishing runner-up in a major she supposedly had no business contending in at all.

Hull's round was a feast of nearly. Nearly pure. Nearly birdie. Nearly glory. But not a drop of regret on the plate. Watching the coverage, one could see her standing in the mixed zone afterward, giving the kind of interview that makes media hover nervously and a certain type of fan lean in.

"I didn't even hit a bad shot on 16," she said, with the conviction of someone who knows. "I hit it so pure the wind didn't even move it an inch."

Golfers can lie, but Hull? Hull might be the rare one telling too much truth. No fibbing about misreads or nerves. No humble bragging about grinding it out. She hit it well. The Welsh wind didn't care. The goddesses of Avalon shrugged. So she moved on.

On 17, she missed a putt she struck well. On 18, she had a high chip over a bunker that would give anyone but Grace Kim flop sweats. She got it close, didn't hole the putt, and signed for a round that any rational player would be proud of. Yet rationality and Major Sundays don't mix.

"I felt like I was in control of my game today. I don't feel like I mis-hit any shots. I hit it pretty pure."

And then, the shrug. Not literal, she's professional and too composed for that, but the verbal equivalent came later, wrapped in adrenaline and her dry delivery:

"At the end of the day, it's just a game."

Of course, that's a lie, too. But a necessary one. Because this *just a game* nearly turned into *her game*. She got within one shot twice and didn't know it because she never looked at a leaderboard.

"Was I even in the lead?"

Had she asked any louder, someone might've howled the scores from the ropes. But Hull's never been one to need numbers to trust her instincts. She plays like someone raised on turf, who learned to spin wedges by feel, and prefers her caddie point out the hole locations like he's holding a map drawn in pencil. Visualizing links shots, she admits, is not her thing. She prefers targets. Trees. Something there.

So of course, she found herself in contention beside Rest Bay, her deeds anything but frail in a place where the target is often "that ragged tuft beyond the dune" or "one bounce shy of the gorse bush left of the TV tower."

"I don't really like links," she said in May. She doubled down on that post-round. "It doesn't suit me. I find it hard to visualize shots."

Watching Hull is like watching someone play poker while forgetting the rules halfway through and still walks off with a straight flush. Her strategy is unconventional, her swing aggressive in the way tavern arguments are aggressive, and her commentary refreshingly unfiltered.

She's also, by her own admission, "kind of insane sometimes." But maybe you have to be? Chasing a major, riding the crowd, three collapses behind you, and the cut line forgotten.

"I hit wayward shots," she said. "But I can get up-and-down and stuff."

That's not just a quote. That's a philosophy. Embroider it on your jumper.

Charley Hull won't be satisfied with another second place, and neither should you. And if you're looking for a true soul of women's golf, the kind that will not go gentle into that good night (or press tent), she's out there plumbobing her putter: a little chipped, a little cheeky, and unmistakably alive.13:[["$","$L1d",null,{"id":"news-list-json-ld","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$1e"}}],["$","div",null,{"className":"bg-white min-h-screen","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-8","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-col lg:flex-row gap-8","children":[["$","main",null,{"className":"flex-1 max-w-4xl","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-center gap-4","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 leading-tight tracking-tight","children":"LPGA%20Analysis"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex-1 h-px bg-gray-300"}]]}]}],["$","section",null,{"className":"pb-16","children":["$","$L1f",null,{"articles":[{"id":"nelly-kordas-week","slug":"nelly-kordas-week","title":"Why Hawaii Could Be Nelly Korda's Breakthrough","author":"George Hack","authorId":"george-hack","date":"2025-09-30","category":"LPGA Analysis","excerpt":"This week’s field opens a rare window for Nelly Korda.
