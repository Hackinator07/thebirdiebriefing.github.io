27:T712,On June 26th, the LPGA and Dow put a new marker down with the [Dow Impact Award](https://corporate.dow.com/en-us/collaborations/dow-sports/sports-partnerships.html), an honor that recognizes players not just for the tournament trophies they collect but for the reach of their work away from the tour.

The inaugural nominees reflect both competitive success and leadership in their communities.

From this group, a committee will cut the list to two finalists on October 7th. Fans will then get their say with open voting, combining with the committee's input to decide the first winner on November 6th. The top award comes with $25,000 and a matching donation to the player's chosen charity, while the runner-up receives $10,000. The money matters, but the real weight here is in giving players a louder microphone for the causes they care about. (Fingers crossed we get a good batch of shots with Mascot Champ, and if there's a little dancing involved, all the better.)

For their part, Dow has been involved with the LPGA since 2018, backing projects like Celebrating the Green and helping the Dow Championship become the first professional event to earn [GEO Certified® Tournament status](https://sustainable.golf/about/certification/). This award feels like the next logical step—less about branding, more about pointing out where values and action line up in the women's game.

[Carlos Padilla II](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cpadilla2/), the Vice President of Global Sports Marketing at Dow, said, "These athletes see obstacles as opportunities and understand the responsibility to leave the world better than they found it."

The full nominee stories are posted at [Celebrating the Green](https://www.lpga.com/news/celebrating-the-green), and that's also where voting opens on October 7th.28:Tb3a,Miranda Wang, the rookie from China who made her name at Duke and ground her way through the Epson Tour, finally turned years of effort into triumph, holding off World No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul to claim her first LPGA title at the FM Championship.

She entered Sunday with a three-shot lead and clung to it most of the way. The 15th hole nearly unraveled her—an errant fairway shot, a rare flash of urgency, and a break from her usual pre-shot routine led to bogey, dropping her a shot behind Thitikul. But Wang steadied herself quickly: she brushed off a missed birdie on 16, then answered with a flawless approach to six feet on 17 and buried the putt to retake the lead. Thitikul, meanwhile, blinked—her chip skidding across the green and setting up a bogey.

“I felt like this could be my week,” Wang said, recalling how her front-nine 29 on Thursday set the tone. “The shots and putts were going so well for me… I just worked really hard and didn’t give up on that.” A composed two-putt par on 18 sealed her 20-under 268 and a $615,000 winner’s check, punctuated by champagne showers from Rose Zhang, her final-round partner and longtime friend.

The win is another step in an impressive journey. Wang helped the Blue Devils capture the 2019 NCAA team title, was the 2022 WAPT Player of the Year, and now joins Shanshan Feng and Ronni Yin as one of China’s LPGA champions—while also becoming the fourth Duke alum to win on tour.

Thitikul, sharp as ever with her irons and putter, finished a shot back at 19 under. Sei Young Kim took solo third, Andrea Lee fourth, and Jin Hee Im tied with Rose Zhang for fifth after a record-tying 10-under 62 on Sunday.

It all underscores the LPGA’s depth this year: 24 winners across 23 events. Wang’s performance adds another, now including 7 rookies.

“Winning on the LPGA has been my dream since I was eight,” Wang said. “I hope this is just the first of many, and I’ll keep pushing myself.” At The FM Championship, her patience, precision, and determination came together beautifully. Here’s to Miranda and her win. A fitting moment in the LPGA’s 75th season--one that keeps finding new ways to thrill.

## Round 4 Competition Highlights

**Miranda Wang** is the 7th rookie to win on LPGA Tour this season.

## Gear Notes

At the time of writing, there’s nothing significant to report.29:Tc6a,The third round of the FM Championship broke open on Saturday under skies that finally stopped threatening rain, and Miranda Wang seized the day. With a bogey-free 65, the 26-year-old Chinese player moved to 18-under, three clear of the field and within reach of her first LPGA win.

What stood out wasn’t just the number (though a seven-birdie round without a blemish is its own statement)--it was the way she carried herself. Wang let birdies come to her. She opened with one at the second, picked off three more on the front, and then let the back nine bloom: 12, 14, and the closer at 18. When her final putt dropped, the gallery gave her an almost riotous cheer.

This stage is a long way from where Wang was a year ago, grinding on partial status and unsure of her next purchase. She made her move this spring on a wildcard at Blue Bay, then surged into rookie contention with a third alongside Lindy Duncan at [Dow](https://www.birdiebriefing.com/news/my-new-favorite-golf-ball/). Now she stands at the front of a tournament that has already seen six rookies win this year, poised to make it seven.

“Today’s performance was definitely a level all players aspire to achieve,” Wang said, smiling as though she knew how rare a day like this can be. “It feels really special to enter the finals as the leader. This is what we strive for every week, so I’m glad I did really well today. I hope I can keep this up.”

The challengers are not lightweights. Rose Zhang, calm as a metronome, posted six birdies against one bogey for a 67, her scorecard clean enough to put her at 15-under and tied for second with Sei Young Kim, who cooled with a 71. Jeeno Thitikul matched Wang’s fireworks with a 65 of her own, Andrea Lee added a 66, and both sit four back. Behind them, Kumkang Park surged with a 64, including an eagle on 4, to join Ayaka Furue (66) and Celine Borge (67) at 13-under.

By late afternoon, the shadows stretched long across the fairways, the crowd thinning into clusters around the 18th green. It had the quiet edge of a Saturday. Everyone sensed that Sunday could swing wild. Wang has the form, the lead, and the confidence. Unpredictable as it’s been, Boston has saved its best for last. Sunday promises to be spectacular.

## Round 3 Competition Highlights

**Miranda Wang** heads into Sunday as she looks to secure her maiden victory.

**Rose Zhang** posted six birdies and one bogey for a 67, keeping herself firmly in contention and tied for second.

**Sei Young Kim** shot a 71, finishing 15-under and tied with Zhang, It was a challenging day for Kim and maintaining a top position on the leaderboard was impressive.

**Kumkang Park** lit up the back nine with a spectacular shot on 17, dubbed “slingshot engaged” by commentators. It was wild to watch on the coverage.

**Jeeno Thitikul** matched Wang with a seven-under 65, making a strong push to climb into the top five and signaling she’s a contender for Sunday.

## Shout Out

**Julia Lopez Ramirez** earns props for consecutive Hole 7 eagles Friday and Saturday.

## Gear Notes

At the time of writing, there’s nothing significant to report.2a:Tddb,Miranda Wang's second round at the FM Championship stretched into an endurance test—ten hours, three rain delays, and one final putt just to close the book. When play stopped, she sat at 11-under, the leader on paper, though the scoreboard still carried the weight of Sei Young Kim's DNF.

Kim showed up this morning like someone who'd been ready all night. Like she played screen golf with her friends and had some Chamisul for good measure. Eagle at the 2nd, birdie-birdie on 3 and 4, and just like that she took the lead away with another 65. It felt like the only way this fractured, stop-and-start round could end—jagged, a little surreal. I'm left drifting, wondering what on earth happened to Nelly Korda?

Even now, I'm trying to make sense of what we saw on TPC Boston's 4th hole. A 298-yard par 4, wind swirling, where the hope and hubris of below-average golfers like me go to die. I'm going to go Midwestern here, but for Pete's sake, Corpuz, A Lim Kim, and Thompson all walked off with double bogeys there?!

The day belonged to the weather—of course it did. I should know better by now, after so many nights in the Boundary Waters, listening to wind howl and rain drum against a tarp while swaying in a hammock. You respect the weather, or it will cut you down. And on this day, the weather owned as much of the story as the golf itself. Players went out beneath heavy gray skies, only to be chased back by rolling thunderstorms. By the time the last horn blew at 7:15 p.m., the round was swallowed by darkness, with 72 players still on the course.

At 7 a.m. they picked up where they left off, closing out the second round before rolling into the third at 12:30. Which leaves us asking: what went down?

Jeeno Thitikul, the world's No. 1, also endured the stop-start pace. She sprinted down the ninth fairway with Green and defending champion Lauren Coughlin as dark clouds rolled in, hoping to beat the next horn. The Thai star finished with a 68, highlighted by four birdies on the back nine. Coughlin walked off with a 73, having double bogeyed the 17th.

We've mentioned her before, but Hannah Green—trying to shake off four straight missed cuts—finally found some rhythm as the thunder rolled. She rattled off five birdies to card a second-round 68, vaulting herself into contention at eight under.

Meanwhile, Sweden's Madelene Sagstrom—maybe right at home in wind and driving rain—stayed in the hunt with a steady putting stroke, six birdies, and a flawless 66. A strong bounce-back after the double bogey on the 2nd hole yesterday.

Finally, Rose Zhang showed the kind of calm, mature play you wouldn't expect from someone just 22. She racked up eight birdies, avoided a single bogey, and positioned herself in solo third at ten under. If she can keep that composure, the rest of the weekend could see her pressing Sei Young and contending for the win.

With the forecast calling for clearer skies, both tournament officials and players are optimistic about getting the schedule back on track for Saturday and Sunday. The main adjustment: after the cut, players will tee off in threesomes for Round 3.

*At the time of this article posting, the cut has been set and Round 3 is underway.*

To the **Tournament Officials and Players** for pressing on regardless.

## Gear Notes

In the future, for moments like these you can bust out a [DrizzleStik](https://www.drizzlestik.com/) or "Drizzy" as Marie and I call it.2b:Tdbf,Thursday's opening round of the FM Championship delivered birdies, sharp iron play, and putting that made the greens at TPC Boston feel alive. Four players, and a rookie or two, had distinctive approaches to the course and the leaderboard.

Korea's Sei Young Kim laid the groundwork, opening with a bogey-free 65. Her precision off the tee and approach shots left little room for error--she missed just two greens all day and hit eight approaches inside 20 feet. From 75–125 yards, her shots averaged just over 10 feet from the hole. Two birdies in the first four holes carried her through the round. "All the birdies make me relax and have confidence," she said. "Momentum's everything." Still, the elusive victory continues to slip through her fingers; Kim has 21 top-10s since 2021 but no win.

Allisen Corpuz matched Kim's 65 to make a statement. From 150–175 yards, she averaged 23 feet to the hole and closed strong with birdies on 15, 16, and 17. "I had a lot of looks and was able to convert," Corpuz said.

American Andrea Lee quietly kept pace with a bogey-free 67 of her own, continuing a run that has her ranked fifth on the LPGA Tour in strokes gained since May and 27 in the world ranking. Balanced iron play and solid putting kept her in contention, underscoring the value of consistency on a course like TPC Boston.

A putter is a confidence machine, and even Nelly Korda isn't immune to its quirks. After losing her No. 1 ranking, she shelved the trusty Spider Tour X and slotted a TaylorMade Del Monte blade with adjustable weights into the bag--a little twist, a little gamble, and a whole lot of "let's see what happens." Well, the swap worked: seven birdies and a 5-under 67. An early bogey at the 4th and another at the 10th didn't faze her. "Just something new… different grip, different feel—I went with it," Korda said. Perhaps it’ll prove rewarding—her streak of made cuts remains unbroken, though that first win of the season still eludes her.

Jodi Ewart Shadoff made moves, birdying the final four holes of her round to join Kim and Corpuz atop the leaderboard at 7-under. Rookie Miranda Wang added flavor to the mix, finishing solo fourth at 6-under after eight birdies on the front nine.

By the close of play, TPC Boston had made its message clear: sharp iron play and confident putting were the keys to a low score. The leaders, having scoped the greens hole by hole, head into Round 2 with a strategy in place. More birdies, a handful of eagles, and a cutline around -1 are likely. It'll be tight, and with ESPN+ feature coverage, every shot will carry a little extra weight.

## Round 1 Competition Highlights

**Sei Young Kim** opens with bogey-free 65 with eight approaches inside 20 feet.

**Allisen Corpuz** matches 65, finishes hot with birdies on 15–17.

**Minjee Lee** with 209 feet of putts, including a 55-foot.

**Andrea Lee** posts 67, showcasing steady, balanced play.

**Nelly Korda** finds some rhythm with her putter shooting 5-under 67.

**Jodi Ewart Shadoff** birdies final four holes to share 7-under lead.

**Wei Wei Zhang** bounces back from recent missed cut, finishing 5-under with an eagle on hole 2.

## Shout Out

We need to praise **Miranda Wang** for an incredible opening round—66 with nine birdies! Simply amazing.

**Frida Kinhult, Mi-Hyang Lee, and Ingrid Lindblad** for dialing in eagles on the 18th hole.

## Gear Notes

**Nelly Korda** using a TaylorMade Del Monte putter with a SuperStroke grip.2c:Tfd8,This wasn't a Sunday stroll along the river for Brooke Henderson. It was a duel. A final round that felt less like stroke play and more like match play, where every birdie and every answer from Minjee Lee hung heavy in the air. By the time Henderson rolled in her final putt and lifted the trophy, the Canadian galleries had their dream ending -- their star back on top, on home soil, for the first time in more than two years.

Henderson's closing 4-under 67 at Mississaugua pushed her to 15 under, one shot clear of Lee's 68. The win marked her second CPKC Women's Open title, her 14th career victory on the LPGA Tour, and an emphatic end to a drought that had stretched across 64 starts.

"This week was beyond special," Henderson said, standing behind the 18th green. "To be able to win my national open again, in front of these crowds… it feels surreal."

**A Sunday Match Play**

The day began with Henderson and Lee tied at 11 under, three clear of the field. The crowd sensed it early: this was no longer a four-day tournament but a head-to-head contest between Canada's brightest star and one of the game's most polished champions.

The momentum swung like a pendulum. At the par-5 13th, Henderson nearly eagled but settled for birdie. Lee answered, rolling in her own. On the very next hole, the pivotal par-3 14th, Henderson made a pure 6-foot birdie putt for a one-stroke lead.

Then came a behind the netter. On the 17th, with the gallery encircling the short par-4, Lee drained a 13-footer for birdie. The roar barely settled before Henderson stepped up and buried her own from 12 feet. Birdie for birdie.

Lee smiled. Henderson clenched her fist. The match ever so tilted Henderson's way. She carried that one-stroke edge to the house.

"I kind of got outplayed," Lee admitted, gracious in defeat. "I did my job. But Brooke was just a little better today."

**A Career Marker**

For Henderson, 27, the victory carries more weight than just number 14 on her career tally. This was her first title since the Diamond Resorts Tournament of Champions in January 2023, and it arrived after months of doubt, struggle, and slipping down the world rankings.

She is projected to leap back into the top 30 in the Race to CME Globe, securing her spot in the season-ending CME Group Tour Championship. More importantly, she reminded herself -- and everyone else -- what a locked-in Brooke Henderson looks like.

When she first won this championship in 2018 at Wascana, she became the first Canadian in 45 years to lift the national title. To do it again, seven years later, in front of her home fans felt like the circle closing once more.

"I thought I might cry, honestly," Henderson said. "It's just been so long. I felt like this week was meant to be."

To our Canadian friends across the Great Lakes, to the thunderous galleries, to those filling sports bars from coast to coast, and to the entire Canadian golf community -- bravo for the way you carried Henderson. Even her peers seemed to understand the weight of the moment. She had fought through doubts and close calls, only to find her game again when the stage demanded it. And so, a Canadian classic was written.

## Round 4 Competition Highlights

**Henderson's** birdie on 14 gave her the solo lead — and she never gave it back.

**Minjee Lee** holed a birdie from 13 feet only for Henderson to answer immediately with her own from 12.

**The galleries around Henderson were massive**, the kind of Canadian following that was Ryder Cup-sized at times.

**Henderson's** up-and-downs on 15 and 16 held her lead steady in the tightest stretch of the round.

Fifteen-year-old phenom **Aphrodite Deng** tied for 20th at 4 under, capping a remarkable week.

**Mao Saigo** finished third at 11 under.

**Akie Iwai**, who led after two rounds, settled for fourth.

## Shout Out

**Canada's** steadfast support for its sports stars was nothing short of inspiring.

## Gear Notes

Henderson sealed the win playing a TaylorMade TP5x golf ball.2d:T1558,Henderson lit up the third round with a 6-under 65, capped by the kind of closing stretch that can tilt a tournament and change the mood of an entire gallery. She birdied the 15th and 16th, holed out from the greenside bunker on the short par-4 17th to ignite the crowd, and finished with a par on 18. Her father and longtime coach, Dave Henderson, even broke his usual stoicism with a rare celebration, pumping his arms as if even he couldn't hold back the noise. The finish pushed her to 11-under and tied with Minjee Lee for the lead.

The bunker shot on 17 was the day's defining moment, a piece of theater. Mississaugua's par-4 seventeenth doesn't look like much on the card, but standing on it in the heat of battle is something different. A big drive leaves only a wedge, and Henderson's left her approach in the front bunker, a tricky lie staring her down with the tournament hanging in the air. What came next was the kind of shot you remember years later: the crisp strike, the thump of sand, and the ball climbing out of the lip before landing soft and tracking straight into the hole. The roar sounded less like a golf clap and more like an arena crowd. Henderson called her round an "A" and admitted she was actually happy to see the ball end up in the sand, knowing she had the chance to pull something off.

She hasn't won since January 2023 or posted a top-10 this season, but her record is daunting: eight victories in her last 11 tries when holding at least a share of the lead heading into Sunday. History may not repeat, but it often rhymes, and Henderson has the kind of winning muscle memory that can carry her across a finish line.

Lee nearly matched Henderson with a 66, a round just as brilliant but built differently-- the kind of steady method she's made a career on. Two eagles, a birdie chip-in, and a deft par save at 18 filled her card. The Australian, who won the KPMG Women's PGA Championship in June, is chasing her 12th LPGA title and her second of the year. Her career has never been about flash, though the numbers say she belongs among the elite: two majors, a slew of wins across three continents, and a knack for playing her best when the courses demand discipline. After years of frustration with the putter, she's turned the switch to the long model into one of the season's most dangerous weapons. When the stroke is rolling, she doesn't just score; she squeezes the air out of the leaderboard.

Three shots back, world No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul sits tied for third with Japan's Akie Iwai. Thitikul's steady 69 kept her in the mix, a quiet round that looked routine on the card but was anything but simple on a course where thick rough and uneven lies lurk at every corner. She carries herself like someone twice her age -- patient, precise, and never hurried -- which makes sense for a player who has spent most of her teenage years ranked inside the world's top five. Iwai, meanwhile, struggled early with 3 bogeys to start her round but steadied herself, and her firepower is the kind that can heat up quickly. Both players loom as serious Sunday dangers.

Canadian amateur Aphrodite Deng shot 68 to reach 6-under, tied for seventh. She needed only 26 putts and continues to showcase a lethal wedge game. A top-12 finish would mark the best LPGA result by an amateur this season, adding another layer of intrigue to an already Canadian-heavy storyline. It isn't just Henderson carrying The Maple Leaf.

For Henderson, the opportunity is singular. A 13-time winner, she's looking to become the first Canadian to win her national open twice since 1914. Winning again, on home soil, would put her in rarefied company and cement her as the most accomplished Canadian player of any era.

The galleries will be hers on Sunday, and she knows it. "Winning in 2018 was a huge career highlight," she said. "To be in this position again is really, really cool. I just hope to get a fast start, make birdies, and get the crowd on my side."

The CPKC Women's Open has grown into something larger than a golf tournament. It carries identity, memory, and emotion—for the fans who fill the ropes as much as for the players inside them. Henderson and Lee have staged a duel worthy of the spotlight, with world No. 1 Thitikul and a fearless amateur close enough to change the script. Whether it finishes in maple-leaf triumph or an Australian claim, Mississaugua is set to deliver a champion in major fashion.

## Round 3 Competition Highlights

**Brooke Henderson** shot 6-under 65, including a holed bunker shot for eagle on 17.

**Minjee Lee** carded a 66 with two eagles (12 and 17) and a par-saving chip-in at 18.

**Jeeno Thitikul** three shots back at 8-under after a steady 69. She recorded five birdies.

**Akie Iwai** dropped to a 72 on Saturday but tied for third at 8-under.

**Aphrodite Deng** needed just 26 putts, converting nearly every look inside 15 feet.

**Leona Maguire** nearly aced the par-3 6th hole.

**Yu Liu** shot a 67 on Saturday to climb into contention at 7-under.

**Pajaree Anannarukarn** is not in contention but leads the Audi Precision Award with 43 greens in regulation.

[TaylorMade Qi35 Driver](https://www.taylormadegolf.com/Qi35-Driver/DW-TC370.html?lang=en_US).2e:Tea8,At Mississaugua, round two delivered shifts, scares, and cheers as players fought for weekend ground. Mississaugua’s first crack at hosting the CPKC Women’s Open showed off quick greens, heavy rough, and a layout built that demanded patience while keeping eagles and birdies hard-earned.

Akie Iwai, fresh off her breakthrough in Portland, continued her strong play and aggressive style. It occasionally cost her. Even so, she closed the day with a steady 2-under 69 to build a three-shot cushion at 9-under, though afterward she admitted to leaving too many birdie chances on the table.

Leona Maguire, one of the most consistent drivers on tour, delivered several long-range putts to stay in contention despite battling with the flatstick at shorter range. Australia’s Minjee Lee and world No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul joined Maguire in the chasing pack at 6-under.

And then there was Brooke Henderson. Even the winningest golfer in Canadian history can still look like she’s cramming for the exam, and Friday was a case study. Henderson, cheered on by the largest gallery of the day, turned in a 5-under 66 that vaulted her 33 spots up the board and away from the cut line that had been uncomfortably close. “I just wanted to get away from the cut line as fast as I could,” she said afterward, and did so with the casual urgency of someone checking their rearview mirror, then stomping on the gas. Any time Henderson’s name creeps near the top of the board on Canadian soil, the energy follows—loud, expectant, and full of possibility.

Stacy Lewis showed her veteran poise with a clever recovery from a penalty area to save par, while Sweden’s Linnea Ström nearly jarred an approach at 17. Young Canadian amateur Aphrodite Deng and Québec’s Maude-Aimée Leblanc brought local flavor to the pairings. Fifteen-year-old Deng cooled off after her electric opening round but still held her ground at 3-under, another reminder that the country's future talent isn't stuck on the bench or skating the second line anymore; she's already teeing it up under the spotlight.

For the weekend, the greens are smooth enough to make a Zamboni driver smile. Iwai holds the lead, Henderson is charging, and the leaderboard is the kind of Saturday puzzle that makes a national championship worth following. With narrow margins, a raucous crowd, veterans holding steady, and young guns pressing, the CPKC Women’s Open heads into the final 36 holes wide open and ready for a thrilling finish.

## Round 2 Competition Highlights

**Akie Iwai** shot a 2-under 69 to take a three-stroke lead at 9-under par.

Canadian fan favorite **Brooke Henderson** made a massive leap up the leaderboard with a 5-under 66, moving 33 spots away from the cut line.

**Maude-Aimée Leblanc**, the Quebec native, who has battled injuries, made a clutch putt, demonstrating the progress she's made.

**Leona Maguire, Minjee Lee, and Jeeno Thitikul** are all tied for second at 6-under, setting up a thrilling final 36 holes.

**Stacy Lewis** saved par with a crafty shot from a penalty area, earning one of the loudest applauses of the day.

**Linnea Ström** nearly holed out at 17, showcasing sharp iron play.

**Yan Liu** posted a four-under round with excellent pace on the greens, moving up the leaderboard.

## Gear Notes

**Brooke Henderson’s driver** is so hot it might set off the sprinklers.2f:T1308,The first round of the CPKC Women's Open gave us a leaderboard that was equal parts expected and surprising. Familiar champions like Jin Young Ko and Nelly Korda went searching for form, Akie Iwai posted a flawless 64 to take the solo lead, and a 15-year-old Canadian amateur with an unshakable stare stole much of the spotlight.

Jin Young Ko--once unstoppable, now two years removed from her last win looked steady, carding 5 birdies, including the par 5s of 12 and 13. Showing the pinpoint iron play that earned her the world No. 1 spot in 2020, this is the same player who went bogey-free over 72 holes to claim this event in 2019--and she’s signaling she could do it again.

Nelly Korda, meanwhile, is still chasing her first victory of 2025 after piling up seven a year ago. Her round was a blend of sharp birdies and a rare stumble at the 175-yard par-3 third. Still, she exhibited the brilliance that makes her game so unmistakable--none better than a wedge from 81 yards that back-spun into easy scoring range. The mudball she faced at 11, the toughest hole of the day, was the kind of bad break that can throw off rhythm, but she salvaged enough to save par.

And then there's sponsor invitee Aphrodite Deng, the Canadian amateur who plays like she's seen this stage before. Just 15 years old and already a U.S. Girls' Junior champion, she led stretches of the day with poise beyond her years. She hit nearly every fairway, stuck approaches close, and even when she missed, her recovery shots carried quiet confidence. Whether it's adrenaline or just youth, Deng hasn't blinked. Six birdies and a first-round 66 have her sitting T2, making her Canadian debut a national storyline.

Megan Kang, 2023's CPKC winner in Vancouver, kept herself firmly in the mix with three birdies in four holes. Kang knows this golf course, knows the pressure, and still makes it look routine. Her controlled fades off the tee and steady putting kept her close to the leader.

Other names surfaced and impressed: Gaby Lopez, showing graceful touch, finished her round tied for second with 7 birdies; rookie Ina Yoon grinding out pars from thick Canadian rough; and Taiwan's Chien Peiyun carded a 68 thanks to her crisp ball striking.

The greens rolled pure--"smooth," one player said--rewarding aggressive iron play but punishing hesitation. Several players noted switching to firmer wedges this week to handle the tight and muddy fringes. Together, the field and Mississaugua produced exactly the kind of test you'd expect from an LPGA stage of this caliber.

## Round 1 Competition Highlights

**Jin Young Ko's** birdie run included a sharp seven-iron at 16 to set up her fourth birdie of the day, showing flashes of her 2019 Ontario form.

**Gaby Lopez** recorded six birdies in her final 10 holes, tying for the most birdies in the field on Thursday with seven.

**Nelly Korda** recovered from a shaky approach on 11 with a perfectly flighted 81-yard wedge at 12 that spun to four feet, keeping her in contention.

**Jeeno Thitikul** also at T2, shot six birdies over her last 10 holes, including back-to-back birdies on Nos. 3-4 and 9-10. It was her first start at the CPKC Women's Open since moving to Rolex No. 1.

**Aphrodite Deng**, the 15-year-old amateur, hit nearly every fairway and dropped just one bogey, holding her ground against seasoned winners and ended R1 as the lowest Canadian in the field.

**Megan Kang**, last year's champion, climbed the board with a burst of birdies on the back nine, demonstrating comfort and poise at Mississaugua.

**Soo Bin Joo** sits 7th at four under, citing improvements in mental game, swing, putting, and chipping for her solid round.

**Leona Maguire** sits T2 after a 66, posting six birdies against one bogey. She missed just one fairway, birdied it, and praised the smooth greens for giving herself plenty of scoring opportunities.

**Yuna Nishimura** electrified the gallery with a long birdie putt that rolled true, a reminder of her fearless putting stroke.

**Hae Ran Ryu** displayed precise iron play with aggressive wedge shots into tucked pins, earning multiple birdies.

**Lindy Duncan** clanged her approach off the flagstick at 16, striking the cup so sharply it dented the metal.

## Gear Notes

Nothing too major to note. A few players opted for stiffer-shafted wedges to better handle the thick, muddy fringes and rough around the course.30:Tf83,Akie Iwai's first win had been circling all season, tapping her shoulder in Thailand, wagging its finger in Los Angeles. Then she watched her twin sister, Chisato, sip champagne in Mexico while she smiled through the twinge of being the other half of the story. On Sunday in Portland, she finally got to write her own ending.

The 23-year-old rookie from Saitama closed with a bogey-free 66 to win The Standard Portland Classic by four, finishing at 24-under. Six birdies and no errors -- the kind of round players dream about but rarely manage when it matters most. She birdied Nos. 5 and 6 to settle herself, then went about the back nine like a painter, deliberate and precise in her strokes. She sealed the victory with birdies on 17 and 18, the last an 18-footer that rolled in with the composure of a player who had already made up her mind about the outcome.

That's when sister Chisato came running across the green, champagne bottle in hand. If the LPGA is still searching for its next great sibling storyline, it found it in that moment -- a younger sister by sixty seconds dousing her twin in fizzy, French affirmation.

The rest of the field deserves their ink. American Gurleen Kaur posted her career-best finish, runner-up at 20-under, and appeared like a player eager to keep going if only there had been a fifth round to play. Linn Grant shared third with Chisato, and Grace Kim stayed in the conversation at 18-under. Even Oregon amateur Kiara Romero made noise with a 64 and a tie for seventh, giving the local Ducks faithful a glimpse of the future. But in truth, the week belonged to Akie.

Her win folds neatly into a larger Japanese surge on tour this year. She became the fifth from her country to win in 2025, joining Chisato, Rio Takeda, Mao Saigo, and British Open champion Miyu Yamashita. It feels less like coincidence and more like a movement, each name sharpening the edge of Japanese golf. And by winning, Akie and Chisato joined a rare sorority -- sisters etched into LPGA history alongside the Kordas, the Jutanugarns, and the Sorenstams.

What will linger from this Sunday, though, isn't the data. It's the image of Akie exhaling on the 72nd green, her mother in tears nearby, the pressure of all those close calls finally lifting.

And so, among the verdure of Portland's towering trees and fairways, Akie Iwai hoisted her first LPGA trophy, champagne-soaked and smiling. She departed Columbia Edgewater no longer the twin giving chase, but the one who had at last arrived.

## Final Round Competition Highlights

**Grace Kim** two back entering the day, led the field in putting despite a couple of three-putts this week; she rolled 3 key birdies on the back nine to finish in 5th with an 18 under 270

**Gurleen Kaur** bounced back from a slow start yesterday, birdieing the 7th, 9th, 10th, and 17th holes, with accurate wedge shots, bringing her within a shot of the lead several times.

**Chisato Iwai** already an LPGA winner; eagled multiple par fives to finish the day at a 64

**Linn Grant** delivered an impressive weekend with rounds of 66-71-65-67. Could she be next to capture a tournament victory? We certainly hope so.

**Aditi Ashok** finished strong, carding three late birdies to reach 17-under, highlighting a standout performance.

**Akie Iwai** sank crucial putts down the stretch, including a long one on the 18th, to secure her win of The Standard Portland Classic and join her sister Chisato as an LPGA champion.

Srixon has had a dominant 2025 season, collecting three majors at the Chevron Championship, Amundi Evian, and AIG Women's Open.31:Tc70,If Akie Iwai hangs on, it'll be a tidy LPGA rookie story: first win, big smile, trophy hoisted. But Round 3 at The Standard Portland Classic proved golf isn't always that neat getting there and how little box scores capture the raw, aggressive play behind them. 

We'd be remiss if we didn't start with Akie Iwai's driver off the deck on 12. She absolutely smoked it -- wide left, steep enough to look like it was hunting for kindling -- and into the towering sequoias it went. Somehow, someway, the ball bounced back into play. What followed wasn't just a save; it was a birdie. What viewed like mayhem was, in fact, a show of artistry.

She stumbled early. A single bogey at 2. That was followed by playing five holes in five under. A 5 wood to 3 feet for eagle on 5, a trio of birdies coming fast. Her pièce de résistance: a 152 yard approach to a foot on the 18th closing her round at 64 and leaving her a steady 18 under 198.

Iwai kept it simple when asked later: "Rely on good tempo. No change (in approach). Aggressive. Aim to the pin." She capped it with a smirk and a cheeky "Pew pew," sharp and focused. Marie and I spun and laughed.

Hot on her trail? Grace Kim. Her 17th hole provided the most important and dramatic incident after her tee shot landed in a nasty lie in the left rough by a sprinkler box. Relief? Denied. The crowd held its breath as she studied the shot, gripped her 7-iron, and ripped it anyway.

In her head and said afterwards: "Oh, please get through the rough." There was a glimmer of hope as the ball landed just right of the green, kicked off the slope, and rolled in for a surreal eagle. An amazing performance sprinkled with a bit of luck.

Other performances include Swede Linn Grant who stayed in contention at 14 under after a 65, saying she wasn't "happy," but was embracing what the round would bring and having fun along the way. 

Gurleen Kaur (70) and Aditi Ashok (65) are just behind, at 13 and 12 under respectively.

Portland's vibe for Round 4? Sharp, fearless, and electric. Iwai's sticking to her approach, attacking pins with purpose and confidence. The story isn't done yet -- just set up, waiting for the final act.

## Round 3 Competition Highlights

**Cassie Porter** is having a strong rookie season, notching eight birdies and two bogeys while chasing the leaders.

**Aditi Ashok** had a clean card for a 65.

**Linn Grant** stayed in contention at 14 under with a 65 which included an eagle on 7

**Gurleen Kaur** clawed back from a double bogey at the first, and later eagled 7 proving she can fight in contention despite first time nerves.

Gray skies hung overhead as the wind swirled the trees and swept across the ryegrass and fescue of the roughs. Still, the conditions favored those with pinpoint approach shots and steady, disciplined play.

Jeongeun Lee5 found her rhythm in a big way, rattling off five birdies in a row from holes 5 through 9. She has been cashing checks with her wedges through two rounds, trusting the sharp end of the bag to do the talking. She’s found 30 of 36 greens, and from that sweet spot of 100 to 125 yards, she’s been carving darts -- twelve swings averaging just 17 and a half feet from the pin! That’s more than five feet better than the tour’s norm, the kind of margin that helps explain why Korea keeps producing world-beaters and why Lee5 looks perfectly comfortable on the course. 

Also making moves was Canada's Savannah Grewal, posting a 67 on the day and making her tied for 8th at -8. Thailand's Jaravee Boonchant (WR 374) stole the spotlight with seven birdies on her way to an impressive 65. 

Grace Kim kept herself in the hunt with some clutch up-and-downs, including a delicate chip from the water's edge on 10 and a textbook bunker escape on 14. Through two rounds she also carried not a simple stick of steel, but a precision putter, the ball chasing her will across the greens. More than a hundred feet of putts have fallen for her each day, and nine times the ball has traveled ten feet or more to the hole. That momentum carried her to -11, locking in a two-way tie for second place.

## Round 2 Competition Highlights

**Jeongeun Lee5** surged to the top with a blistering stretch of five straight birdies, reaching 12-under and leading by two shots at one stage. She followed her hot streak with a key par save at the par-5 10th.

**Gurleen Kaur** posted 12 pars and birdies for a 68, tying her with Grace Kim for second place.  

**Stacy Lewis** recovered from a short missed birdie on 10 with birdies at 12, 14, and 16 displaying some excellent putting tempo.

**Linn Grant** had a streaky day, making important par saves but struggling at times with the putter including a bogey on 12.

**Gigi Stoll**, a hometown player from Oregon, had family following and nearly holed a chip early in her round, ultimately finishing the day with a 70.

**Amelia Lewis (179th CME)** battled to make the most of her limited LPGA status, executing a key bunker save under pressure.

**Gabby Ruffels** played with her brother Ryan on the bag, delivering a strong approach into 18 in her bid to contend.

**Rose Zhang and Xiaowen Yin** are tied for 27th after matching rounds of 64, with Zhang making a standout eagle on the par-4 ninth.

**Julia Lopez Ramirez** turned in a masterclass in par saves, carding 16 of them on the day.

**Ashley Buhai** switched to a new putter after her South Africa coaching session, rolling in five birdies to finish 4-under.33:T1119,Columbia Edgewater opened cool and calm on day one, with barely a hint of wind – perfect conditions for what felt like a spring-loaded leaderboard. Even with limited broadcast coverage, every time you glanced away, someone else was making a move. The air had a crispness the previous days lacked, forcing players to adjust and keeping them sharp throughout the round. The tree-lined fairways delighted some, while others felt boxed in, more looking down a narrow bowling lane. The greens rolled true and fast, a solid 12 on the stimp according to some.

Brooke Henderson set the tone with a four-birdie streak right out of the gate. Wichanee Meechai fired off a birdie-eagle-birdie start that had the gallery whispering and the crows cawing. Chisato Iwai, blending in with her Oregon green top, finished at three under, highlighted by an impressive eagle on the 463-yard par-5 seventh.

American Gurleen Kaur posted up eight birdies, while China's Miranda Wang navigated around the towering trees to card a bogey-free round, saving par eleven times. Abacaya Yubol kept her card clean with twelve pars and no bogeys, finishing the day tied for fourth alongside Haeran Ryu. Jin Young Ko of South Korea delivered a commanding performance, carding a five-under-par round with 13 pars and five birdies.

In the afternoon wave, rookie Adéla Cernousek and fellow Frenchwoman Perrine Delacour made their presence felt, finishing at 8-under and 6-under, respectively.

So, at the end of Round 1 Adéla Cernousek rests alone atop the leaderboard at 8-under. A five-way logjam at 7-under sees Henderson, Kaur, Lee5, Park, and M. Wang all in the mix, while a tightly packed chase group -- including Buhai, Grant, Ryu, Yubol, and Delacour -- tied for seventh, keeps the tension high heading into Round 2.

## Round 1 Competition Highlights

**Brooke Henderson** stuck a solid third shot on the par-5 10th for birdie to start her round, added another on 11, and went a perfect four-for-four on birdies through 13.

**Adéla Cernousek**, the rookie from Antibes, France, showcased her technical, course management driven style to finish alone in first at 8-under including an eagle on 7.

**Caroline Masson's** 7-iron at the par-3 second was so pure she didn't even see it disappear. Hidden behind a bunker, the ball found the cup for her first ace of the year, sending a ripple of cheers across the gallery.

**Perrine Delacour**, currently ranked 118 in the world, had a phenomenal day posting 4 birdies on the front 9 and finishing tied for 7th.

**Rose Zhang**, hindered by injury and a stop-start schedule struggled early, including double bogeys on 10 and 13, never quite finding her rhythm.

**Wichanee Meechai** fired off a birdie-eagle-birdie start but finished even for the day.

**Lilia Vu** was working to regain the form that once took her to World No. 1. 16 pars and 1 birdie on the day to end even.

**Caroline Inglis** playing on her home course came close to recreating her past heroics at the 13th, setting up a short birdie putt and finishing at 2-under.

**Chisato Iwai**, blending in with her Oregon green top, finished at three under, highlighted by an impressive eagle on the 463-yard par-5 seventh.

**Jin Young Ko's** ball striking was sharp all day, producing a commanding five-under round built on 13 pars and five birdies.

**Lauren Coughlin** pushed her way to four-under with a strong putting performance and an aggressive approach off the tees.

**Yuka Saso** carded four birdies, but double bogeys on 9 and 11 knocked her back, leaving her at 6-over for the day.

**Abacaya Yubol** held a one-shot lead at one point and kept a spotless card with twelve pars and no bogeys, ending the day tied for 6th.

American **Gurleen Kaur** posted eight birdies.

**Gigi Stoll** stumbled with a triple bogey on the 426-yard par-4 third but recovered to shoot an even-par 72 for the round.

## Shout Out
