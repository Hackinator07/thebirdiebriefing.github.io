28:Tdbf,Thursday's opening round of the FM Championship delivered birdies, sharp iron play, and putting that made the greens at TPC Boston feel alive. Four players, and a rookie or two, had distinctive approaches to the course and the leaderboard.

Korea's Sei Young Kim laid the groundwork, opening with a bogey-free 65. Her precision off the tee and approach shots left little room for error--she missed just two greens all day and hit eight approaches inside 20 feet. From 75–125 yards, her shots averaged just over 10 feet from the hole. Two birdies in the first four holes carried her through the round. "All the birdies make me relax and have confidence," she said. "Momentum's everything." Still, the elusive victory continues to slip through her fingers; Kim has 21 top-10s since 2021 but no win.

Allisen Corpuz matched Kim's 65 to make a statement. From 150–175 yards, she averaged 23 feet to the hole and closed strong with birdies on 15, 16, and 17. "I had a lot of looks and was able to convert," Corpuz said.

American Andrea Lee quietly kept pace with a bogey-free 67 of her own, continuing a run that has her ranked fifth on the LPGA Tour in strokes gained since May and 27 in the world ranking. Balanced iron play and solid putting kept her in contention, underscoring the value of consistency on a course like TPC Boston.

A putter is a confidence machine, and even Nelly Korda isn't immune to its quirks. After losing her No. 1 ranking, she shelved the trusty Spider Tour X and slotted a TaylorMade Del Monte blade with adjustable weights into the bag--a little twist, a little gamble, and a whole lot of "let's see what happens." Well, the swap worked: seven birdies and a 5-under 67. An early bogey at the 4th and another at the 10th didn't faze her. "Just something new… different grip, different feel—I went with it," Korda said. Perhaps it’ll prove rewarding—her streak of made cuts remains unbroken, though that first win of the season still eludes her.

Jodi Ewart Shadoff made moves, birdying the final four holes of her round to join Kim and Corpuz atop the leaderboard at 7-under. Rookie Miranda Wang added flavor to the mix, finishing solo fourth at 6-under after eight birdies on the front nine.

By the close of play, TPC Boston had made its message clear: sharp iron play and confident putting were the keys to a low score. The leaders, having scoped the greens hole by hole, head into Round 2 with a strategy in place. More birdies, a handful of eagles, and a cutline around -1 are likely. It'll be tight, and with ESPN+ feature coverage, every shot will carry a little extra weight.

## Round 1 Competition Highlights

**Sei Young Kim** opens with bogey-free 65 with eight approaches inside 20 feet.

**Allisen Corpuz** matches 65, finishes hot with birdies on 15–17.

**Minjee Lee** with 209 feet of putts, including a 55-foot.

**Andrea Lee** posts 67, showcasing steady, balanced play.

**Nelly Korda** finds some rhythm with her putter shooting 5-under 67.

**Jodi Ewart Shadoff** birdies final four holes to share 7-under lead.

**Wei Wei Zhang** bounces back from recent missed cut, finishing 5-under with an eagle on hole 2.

## Shout Out

We need to praise **Miranda Wang** for an incredible opening round—66 with nine birdies! Simply amazing.

**Frida Kinhult, Mi-Hyang Lee, and Ingrid Lindblad** for dialing in eagles on the 18th hole.

## Gear Notes

**Nelly Korda** using a TaylorMade Del Monte putter with a SuperStroke grip.29:T1308,The first round of the CPKC Women's Open gave us a leaderboard that was equal parts expected and surprising. Familiar champions like Jin Young Ko and Nelly Korda went searching for form, Akie Iwai posted a flawless 64 to take the solo lead, and a 15-year-old Canadian amateur with an unshakable stare stole much of the spotlight.

Jin Young Ko--once unstoppable, now two years removed from her last win looked steady, carding 5 birdies, including the par 5s of 12 and 13. Showing the pinpoint iron play that earned her the world No. 1 spot in 2020, this is the same player who went bogey-free over 72 holes to claim this event in 2019--and she’s signaling she could do it again.

Nelly Korda, meanwhile, is still chasing her first victory of 2025 after piling up seven a year ago. Her round was a blend of sharp birdies and a rare stumble at the 175-yard par-3 third. Still, she exhibited the brilliance that makes her game so unmistakable--none better than a wedge from 81 yards that back-spun into easy scoring range. The mudball she faced at 11, the toughest hole of the day, was the kind of bad break that can throw off rhythm, but she salvaged enough to save par.

And then there's sponsor invitee Aphrodite Deng, the Canadian amateur who plays like she's seen this stage before. Just 15 years old and already a U.S. Girls' Junior champion, she led stretches of the day with poise beyond her years. She hit nearly every fairway, stuck approaches close, and even when she missed, her recovery shots carried quiet confidence. Whether it's adrenaline or just youth, Deng hasn't blinked. Six birdies and a first-round 66 have her sitting T2, making her Canadian debut a national storyline.

Megan Kang, 2023's CPKC winner in Vancouver, kept herself firmly in the mix with three birdies in four holes. Kang knows this golf course, knows the pressure, and still makes it look routine. Her controlled fades off the tee and steady putting kept her close to the leader.

Other names surfaced and impressed: Gaby Lopez, showing graceful touch, finished her round tied for second with 7 birdies; rookie Ina Yoon grinding out pars from thick Canadian rough; and Taiwan's Chien Peiyun carded a 68 thanks to her crisp ball striking.

The greens rolled pure--"smooth," one player said--rewarding aggressive iron play but punishing hesitation. Several players noted switching to firmer wedges this week to handle the tight and muddy fringes. Together, the field and Mississaugua produced exactly the kind of test you'd expect from an LPGA stage of this caliber.

## Round 1 Competition Highlights

**Jin Young Ko's** birdie run included a sharp seven-iron at 16 to set up her fourth birdie of the day, showing flashes of her 2019 Ontario form.

**Gaby Lopez** recorded six birdies in her final 10 holes, tying for the most birdies in the field on Thursday with seven.

**Nelly Korda** recovered from a shaky approach on 11 with a perfectly flighted 81-yard wedge at 12 that spun to four feet, keeping her in contention.

**Jeeno Thitikul** also at T2, shot six birdies over her last 10 holes, including back-to-back birdies on Nos. 3-4 and 9-10. It was her first start at the CPKC Women's Open since moving to Rolex No. 1.

**Aphrodite Deng**, the 15-year-old amateur, hit nearly every fairway and dropped just one bogey, holding her ground against seasoned winners and ended R1 as the lowest Canadian in the field.

**Megan Kang**, last year's champion, climbed the board with a burst of birdies on the back nine, demonstrating comfort and poise at Mississaugua.

**Soo Bin Joo** sits 7th at four under, citing improvements in mental game, swing, putting, and chipping for her solid round.

**Leona Maguire** sits T2 after a 66, posting six birdies against one bogey. She missed just one fairway, birdied it, and praised the smooth greens for giving herself plenty of scoring opportunities.

**Yuna Nishimura** electrified the gallery with a long birdie putt that rolled true, a reminder of her fearless putting stroke.

**Hae Ran Ryu** displayed precise iron play with aggressive wedge shots into tucked pins, earning multiple birdies.

**Lindy Duncan** clanged her approach off the flagstick at 16, striking the cup so sharply it dented the metal.

## Shout Out

Puppy pets to Blue, the German Shepherd-Malinois mix from the [Halton Regional Police Service](https://www.haltonpolice.ca/en/index.aspx), for holding down duties as the official course dog.

## Gear Notes

Nothing too major to note. A few players opted for stiffer-shafted wedges to better handle the thick, muddy fringes and rough around the course.2a:T1119,Columbia Edgewater opened cool and calm on day one, with barely a hint of wind – perfect conditions for what felt like a spring-loaded leaderboard. Even with limited broadcast coverage, every time you glanced away, someone else was making a move. The air had a crispness the previous days lacked, forcing players to adjust and keeping them sharp throughout the round. The tree-lined fairways delighted some, while others felt boxed in, more looking down a narrow bowling lane. The greens rolled true and fast, a solid 12 on the stimp according to some.

Brooke Henderson set the tone with a four-birdie streak right out of the gate. Wichanee Meechai fired off a birdie-eagle-birdie start that had the gallery whispering and the crows cawing. Chisato Iwai, blending in with her Oregon green top, finished at three under, highlighted by an impressive eagle on the 463-yard par-5 seventh.

American Gurleen Kaur posted up eight birdies, while China's Miranda Wang navigated around the towering trees to card a bogey-free round, saving par eleven times. Abacaya Yubol kept her card clean with twelve pars and no bogeys, finishing the day tied for fourth alongside Haeran Ryu. Jin Young Ko of South Korea delivered a commanding performance, carding a five-under-par round with 13 pars and five birdies.

In the afternoon wave, rookie Adéla Cernousek and fellow Frenchwoman Perrine Delacour made their presence felt, finishing at 8-under and 6-under, respectively.

So, at the end of Round 1 Adéla Cernousek rests alone atop the leaderboard at 8-under. A five-way logjam at 7-under sees Henderson, Kaur, Lee5, Park, and M. Wang all in the mix, while a tightly packed chase group -- including Buhai, Grant, Ryu, Yubol, and Delacour -- tied for seventh, keeps the tension high heading into Round 2.

## Round 1 Competition Highlights

**Brooke Henderson** stuck a solid third shot on the par-5 10th for birdie to start her round, added another on 11, and went a perfect four-for-four on birdies through 13.

**Adéla Cernousek**, the rookie from Antibes, France, showcased her technical, course management driven style to finish alone in first at 8-under including an eagle on 7.

**Caroline Masson's** 7-iron at the par-3 second was so pure she didn't even see it disappear. Hidden behind a bunker, the ball found the cup for her first ace of the year, sending a ripple of cheers across the gallery.

**Perrine Delacour**, currently ranked 118 in the world, had a phenomenal day posting 4 birdies on the front 9 and finishing tied for 7th.

**Rose Zhang**, hindered by injury and a stop-start schedule struggled early, including double bogeys on 10 and 13, never quite finding her rhythm.

**Wichanee Meechai** fired off a birdie-eagle-birdie start but finished even for the day.

**Lilia Vu** was working to regain the form that once took her to World No. 1. 16 pars and 1 birdie on the day to end even.

**Caroline Inglis** playing on her home course came close to recreating her past heroics at the 13th, setting up a short birdie putt and finishing at 2-under.

**Chisato Iwai**, blending in with her Oregon green top, finished at three under, highlighted by an impressive eagle on the 463-yard par-5 seventh.

**Jin Young Ko's** ball striking was sharp all day, producing a commanding five-under round built on 13 pars and five birdies.

**Lauren Coughlin** pushed her way to four-under with a strong putting performance and an aggressive approach off the tees.

**Yuka Saso** carded four birdies, but double bogeys on 9 and 11 knocked her back, leaving her at 6-over for the day.

**Abacaya Yubol** held a one-shot lead at one point and kept a spotless card with twelve pars and no bogeys, ending the day tied for 6th.

American **Gurleen Kaur** posted eight birdies.

**Gigi Stoll** stumbled with a triple bogey on the 426-yard par-4 third but recovered to shoot an even-par 72 for the round.

## Shout Out

Filipino golf fans have reason to be excited as **Dottie Ardina** posted a superb -3 for the day. Ardina looked incredibly sharp throughout her round, displaying a level of control and confidence that suggests her game may reach top form over the course of the weekend.
