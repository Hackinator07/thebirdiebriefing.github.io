This wasn't the kind of Sunday for ice cream at [Charley's Mini Golf](https://www.instagram.com/p/DMlTbKKN7h2/?hl=en&img_index=1). Spectators weren't whispering; they were holding their breath. Charley Hull found herself with a short putt to win her third LPGA event, yet the story wasn't just about her ball. It was also about one that had just rolled and rolled far too many times off the putter of the world's best player. [Jeeno Thitikul had just four-putted](https://youtube.com/shorts/t3uoJslHLS4?si=mcb089QgETyd1Vjx) from a range that should've been routine, her last stroke a decelerated push. It was a tragedy that makes even casual fans wince and think to themselves, "She's one of us." 

The crowd looked ill, and Hull incredulous.

She stepped away from her own putt twice, plumb bobbed her [TP Hydro Blast](https://www.taylormadegolf.com/TP-Hydro-Blast-Soto-/DW-TA327.html?lang=en_US) like she was lining up a bet she couldn't afford to lose, then rolled it. Dead center. Pin still in as always. And with that, she won her first event of 2025.

"I didn't really process it," Hull said afterward. "Jeeno played great today. She was very solid. Unfortunate what happened to her on the last hole. At the end of the day, I just felt like I needed a little bit of luck on my side in the last few years because I don't feel like it's ever gone my way and it's finally got my way for once. Every dog has its day."

It had been 1,077 days since Hull's last LPGA win, at the Volunteers of America Classic in 2022. She made sure to end the drought in style—posting rounds of 68-65-67-68 to finish 20-under 268 and collect $300,000.

In reality, the final round was a duel long before they walked up to 18. Hull started with the lead but slipped a shot behind on 14 when Thitikul rolled in a birdie. [She answered on 16, sinking a long birdie putt](https://youtu.be/M1SAih6OXUQ?t=244) after splashing it in the bunker off the tee. She then gave it right back with a bogey at 17. Thitikul's steady par there sent her to the last with a one-shot cushion. Hull admitted she thought she had to eagle the 18th just to have a chance.

"On 18, pushed my driver a little bit. Hit a nice cut 9-iron round the tree. Didn't quite cut. Thought I had to hole the putt and just two-putted," Hull said. "I don't really remember much from the last hole. It was a little bit of a shock. I was nervous over that putt. My hands were shaking. I think I was more shocked, and the adrenaline and everything."

I called Hull the ["Queen of the Almost"](https://www.birdiebriefing.com/news/charley-hull-queen-almost/) earlier this summer, after she'd managed to collect her runner-up at the AIG Women's Open at Porthcawl. Her road to this moment hasn't been smooth. She battled injuries all season—torn ankle ligaments, a back injury from lifting a box, and even a virus that caused her to withdraw from Evian after she fainted. When asked if she plays better hurt, Hull didn't hesitate: "It slows my mind down. I always find when I'm poorly, ill, I usually play good golf. My mind is 100 miles an hour, but when I'm poorly, I find I'm more relaxed, and I probably expect less and do less. My days are usually full out, going to the gym, golf, practice. When I'm kind of poorly or injured I do a lot less and I put less pressure on myself. Then I kind of do better sometimes."

This is all on brand for Charley Hull: she doesn't just play; she insists on being part of the story. She's aggressive off the tee, unafraid to fire at pins, and when she's on, you're captivated.

Was this win gift-wrapped by Thitikul's collapse? Absolutely. But Hull had to be there to capitalize on it.

Queen of the Almost no more. Queen of Cincinnati is silly but has a ring to it.

*Note: At this point, an entire season of different winners almost feels inevitable. If the No. 1 player in the world can lose her hands on the final green like that, then golf in 2025 on the LPGA Tour is officially a fever dream.*

## Gear Notes

Nothing of major note from round 4.21:Td60,[The Kroger Queen City Championship presented by P&G](https://queencitylpga.com/) is coming back to Ohio, and this week it lands again at TPC River’s Bend, a course carved into the rolling hills just north of Cincinnati. From September 11–14, 144 of the best players in the world will tee it up for a $2 million purse, and with the way this LPGA season has gone—no repeat winners yet—the story feels wide open.

River’s Bend isn’t new to big stages. The course hosted the PGA TOUR Champions Kroger Classic, the Korn Ferry Tour’s Chiquita Classic, and the Epson Tour’s Prasco Charity Championship. Built in 2001, it’s an Arnold Palmer and Ed Seay course that asks players to hit every shot in the bag and has been called one of the best new private clubs in the country. It’s big enough for the crowds and precise enough to expose mistakes. It should be a compelling canvas for where the leaderboard will shift from day to day, and you’ll see desperate charges just to cling to the cut, along with the kind of bottom-of-the-board wreckage that draws out the morbidly curious.

**Key Players to Follow**

**Heather Lin** and **Polly Mack** punched their tickets through Monday qualifying, carding 3-under 69s to snag the final spots in a field that’s as stacked as the tour has seen short of a major. Keep an eye on Lin and Mack—they’ve already proven they can hang with the best, and this week, they could turn heads.

Defending champion **Lydia Ko** returns with the kind of iron will and ball-striking that makes her a natural favorite. After a five-stroke cinch here last year and a season highlighted by her 23rd career win at the HSBC Women’s World Championship, expect her near the top come Sunday.

[World No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul](https://www.birdiebriefing.com/news/jeeno-thitikul-quiet-stride/) demands attention. The breaks are due to tilt her way. Four top-10s in six starts prove she’s steady, but she remembers the sting of finishing runner-up to Ko here last year—and she’s not planning to let that happen again.

And keep an eye on **Minjee Lee**, the 2023 Queen City winner, who’s racking up top finishes all season, including a KPMG Women’s PGA victory. With the Rolex Player of the Year and CME Globe races heating up, she’s right on the leaders’ heels and tops the LPGA money list. Expect her to run the boards with confident putting and push hard every step of the way this week.

**Be Part of It**

Kroger and P&G are betting big on what this tournament stands for: world-class women’s golf in Cincinnati and a stage for more than just the game. They’ve called in Outlyr—the folks behind the Meijer Classic and Dow Championship—so expect more than a typical tour stop. Smooth organization, a welcoming vibe, and something to see around every corner.

There will be general [admission tickets](https://queencitylpga.com/tickets/) at $59.16 weekly, or $29.58 daily. Champions Club will be $757.25 weekly or $201.14 daily. Active duty, veterans, reservists, National Guard, and first responders receive free daily admission with ID or service verification. Children 17 & under get free daily grounds admission with a ticketed adult.

Queen City is lining up the sharpest field on the planet in a season still figuring out its story. It might crown a repeat winner or throw a curve no one saw coming. Either way, you’ll want to be there.13:[["$","$L1d",null,{"id":"news-list-json-ld","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$1e"}}],["$","div",null,{"className":"bg-white min-h-screen","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-8","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-col lg:flex-row gap-8","children":[["$","main",null,{"className":"flex-1 max-w-4xl","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-center gap-4","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 leading-tight tracking-tight","children":"Cincinnati"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex-1 h-px bg-gray-300"}]]}]}],["$","section",null,{"className":"pb-16","children":["$","$L1f",null,{"articles":[{"id":"queen-city-round-4-2025","slug":"queen-city-round-4-2025","title":"Queen of the City: Charley Hull Wins in Cincinnati","author":"George Hack","authorId":"george-hack","date":"2025-09-15","category":"Tournament Golf","excerpt":"After a season of near misses and injuries, Charley Hull finally broke through at TPC River's Bend.
