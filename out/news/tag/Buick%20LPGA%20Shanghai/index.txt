The Buick LPGA Shanghai is again hosted by [Qizhong Garden Golf Club](http://www.qizhonggolf.com/en/). This is a 72-hole, no-cut event featuring 82 players and offering a $2.2 million purse.

**The Course**

Qizhong Garden Golf Club was [designed by Dana Fry and Jason Straka's Global Golf Course Design](https://www.frystraka.com/course-gallery/qizhong) in collaboration with Jun Lu, one of China's top golf course architects. Spread across 1,000 acres, the course follows the land's natural lakes and mounds, creating rare elevation changes for Shanghai. Its fairways roll and dip, offering a mix of beauty and strategy that suits modern championship play. Beneath it all runs 60,000 meters of drainage pipe, allowing the course to recover within minutes after heavy rain. The result is a layout that feels both distinctly Chinese and built for the global stage.

**The Tournament Players**

Leading the local contingent is defending champion Ronni Yin, who returns for her first start since missing the cut at the AIG Women's Open. Her 2024 performance in Shanghai was one of the season's most complete showings, highlighted by four rounds in the 60s, only three bogeys all week, and a six-shot win. While Yin hasn't found the same form since midsummer, a return home may be the reset she needs.

Underscoring the LPGA's growth in the region is the 21-player Chinese contingent—the largest ever for this event. Alongside Yin, notables include Liu Ruixin, Liu Yu, and Muni He, all with LPGA Tour experience, as well as rising prospects like Xiaowen Yin and Yu Yuan Jiang. Collectively, they represent nearly every major golf province in the country, from Guangdong to Tianjin. For many, this week marks a rare chance to test themselves against the Tour's top tier on home soil.

World No. 1 Jeeno Thitikul headlines the event after a short break from competition. She finished runner-up in her last two starts and led late at the Kroger Queen City Championship before a four-putt on the 72nd hole cost her a playoff with Charley Hull. Thitikul tied for fifth here last year and has consistently performed well on faster greens, a condition that could favor her in Shanghai.

Thitikul and Yin join a field loaded with talent. Eight more players from the world's top 25 are here, including Minjee Lee, Angel Yin, Miyu Yamashita, Hye-Jin Choi, Ariya Jutanugarn, and Sei Young Kim. The next wave isn't far behind, with nine rookies playing their way into Shanghai with strong seasons, led by Julia Lopez Ramirez, Jenny Bae, Ina Yoon, and Saki Baba. Danielle Kang, a two-time winner here, returns on a sponsor exemption, joined by Muni He, Chih Yen Chang, and amateur Yu Yuan Jinang, making for a strong field with plenty of intrigue.

When Youmin Hwang won the LOTTE Championship, she became the 26th different champion of the 2025 season, which tied the all-time record. Another new winner this week would make it 27, a mark not seen in LPGA history. Ten of those 26 winners are in the Shanghai field, including Minjee Lee, Angel Yin, Jeeno Thitikul, and Rio Takeda, each with a chance to become the season's first repeat champion.

**Viewing Details**
