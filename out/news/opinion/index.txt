Marie and I have been following your game both on and off the course [(thanks to your Insta)](https://www.instagram.com/gigistoll_/), and we just have to say -- you crush it. The swagger, baseball Oakleys, long socks, and street-style threads made for golf -- your whole package just works. You’re showing that golf doesn’t have to be stiff, that it doesn’t have to wear pastel polos. You make it look easy.

And then there’s your music. [GG AKA Golf God](https://youtu.be/8v4wqc8X3hQ?si=upVZ6uXtvCR9sdzm). You’re writing lyrics and recording tracks like “Attention,” “Jealous,” and “Summer Love” while living as a touring pro. You do it without anyone needing to validate it. Few athletes -- or people, really -- could pull that off with this much truth.

We also read about how cutting your hair at the University of Arizona symbolizes personal freedom, and you’ve carried that truth forward ever since. You’ve turned your platform into one of encouragement, showing that life is too short to hide or conform. A life of truth that runs parallel to your golf journey. You show us that excellence doesn’t demand giving up what makes us unique. That it is possible to be multidimensional and brilliant all at once. 

And Gigi, what a joy to read you popped the question to your partner in the mountains of Switzerland. That is a beautiful, rare thing, and it deserves to be celebrated fully. Let it be a bright moment that adds even more light to your already vibrant life.

Keep swinging with style, speaking with honesty, and living with that fearless, unapologetic energy. We’ll be cheering from the gallery, excited to see where your next shot, song, or adventure takes you.

- Marie and George25:Te16,I've picked up my share of Titleist Pro V1s and Srixon Z-STARs. Balls lost and found like trophies from roughs and water hazards. I keep a handful in my bag, pulling them out when I'm convinced my slice has checked out for good. Call it superstition, but those balls start feeling like more than just urethane. But now, I have a new favorite: Champ. Or Champy, as Marie and I call him, the mascot of [The Dow Championship](https://dowchampionship.com/).

Why Champy? It's not sold in fun colors and doesn't offer a short game spin that my skills barely benefit from. Well, it's garnered something else from me: admiration.

June was a scorcher for players, right? Texas bakes them in the mid-90s with a heat index over 100 degrees. Then, windburned and weary, they haul themselves up north to Michigan, where it's a refreshing 75 to 80. And what else do they get when they roll into Midland Country Club? Not just a cozy golf course and a friendly crowd—but Champy, on its first birthday, dishing out cupcakes [next to a loon](https://www.milb.com/great-lakes/ballpark/lou-e). That's just part of what makes Champy and The Dow so admirable.

There's warmth and intimacy you don't find everywhere. It's a tight-knit Midwestern golf community where Dow employees and folks from neighboring towns show up shoulder-to-shoulder to cheer on the players and sing happy birthday to a giant, fluffy golf ball. It's a team event, too—the sort that can jolt a player's season back to life when the grind starts wearing thin. You can sense how much the players love it. You catch it in the laughter, feel it buzzing in the air, and see it shining through playful team names like Biggie Smalls, the Kilted Koalas, and Born to the Islands.

And all this aids the LPGA Tour in being more than a series of tournaments that showcases top-tier talent--it attracts new fans by mixing competition with that genuine community spirit. It is helping the game grow beyond the usual circles, bringing fresh eyes and enthusiasm to the sport. It makes the LPGA an even more powerful platform for promoting women's golf worldwide.

It's also where sponsorships make a real difference. Partnerships like Dow's don't just keep the tournament running; they fuel the visibility and opportunities female athletes need to thrive. In a world where women's sports still fight for equal airtime and funding, these sponsorships help bridge the gap, allowing players to chase their dreams and providing a venue for fans to watch.

And speaking of admiration, the tournament's ambassador, Suzann Pettersen, also embodies everything this event stands for. As a Solheim Cup captain, two-time major champion, and founder of [TeamVOXA(an athlete-first talent management group)](https://teamvoxa.com/), she's more than just a name. She's a role model who shows young girls what's possible when determination meets opportunity. Her leadership and vision help light the path for the next generation of female golfers, proving that success on and off the course goes hand in hand.

So yes, Champy might not spin like a Pro V1, but it's got heart and hustle and is the face of what's arguably one of the best weeks on the LPGA calendar. And it knows how to host the kind of party where the buzz never fades, strangers turn into friends, and the drama on the course has a rival in the fun and growth happening off it.

It’s the kind of experience that folds itself into you and reminds you why we watch, why we play, and why, no matter the ball in your bag, the soul of the game stays with you long after Champy blows out the candles.16:[["$","$L21",null,{"id":"news-list-json-ld","type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$22"}}],["$","div",null,{"className":"bg-white min-h-screen","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 md:px-6 py-8","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-col lg:flex-row gap-8","children":[["$","main",null,{"className":"flex-1 max-w-4xl","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-center gap-4","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 leading-tight tracking-tight title-overlap","children":"Opinion"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex-1 h-px bg-gray-300"}]]}]}],["$","section",null,{"className":"pb-16","children":["$","$L23",null,{"articles":[{"id":"gigi-stoll-drip","slug":"gigi-stoll-drip","title":"Your Drip Hits Different -- A Letter to Gigi Stoll","author":"George Hack","authorId":"george-hack","date":"2025-08-30","category":"Opinion","excerpt":"Gigi Stoll makes golf look effortless—and stylish.
