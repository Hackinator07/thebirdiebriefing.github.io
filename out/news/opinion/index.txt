20:Tda5,There are certain courses that make no sense on paper or even when you're standing on the first tee but feel just right when you're actually playing in them. [Lodi Golf Club, though colloquially we've taken to calling it Lodi National](http://www.lodigolf.com/), is exactly that kind of place. It's a nine-hole cut into a driftless hillside that asks little but gives plenty. From the tips it is a par 35 at 3,048 yards. No, it is not the kind of place a glossy brochure brags about, but the kind that matters. Where small wins last longer than your perfect drive that rolled down the slope again, and a $20 bill and a bit of time somehow deliver more than money ever should.

Walk past the sheds full of member golf carts, step into the little clubhouse, and you'll find yourself offered a frozen Snickers, some used golf balls that yes, tumbled down the hill, and the chance to buy a hat with the town mascot, [Susie the Duck](https://www.lodilakewisconsin.org/susie-the-duck/), on it. Look out the window and you'll see the 9th green and catch something rarer: the sound of folks who play for the sake of it. Not networking, not prestige--just the pure, slightly crooked joy of seeing a golf ball tumble across land that has seen more deer than FootJoys.

The course itself? Well, "National" isn't that much of a stretch. IT IS HARD. The night before a tee time, I'll catch myself thinking about that opening hole, trying to will myself not to screw it up in the morning. No. 1 does not lull you into anything. It is tough, a 294-yard par-4 that ends in an elevated green where, if you miss, your ball lands in tall grass or rolls down the slope never to be seen again. Each hole has its quirks, and quirks, I'd argue, are better than pedigree. No. 2 is a sharp 90-degree dogleg right, framed by hickory trees waiting in the rough. The 434-yard No. 5 doglegs just enough to dare you into a mistake. Your approach shot there then must carry or avoid the "lake" that the entire course slopes to. No. 7 feels uphill even when it's not. You can hit a beautiful drive and still never find your ball, which somehow flew over the berm and disappeared even though you swore it landed in the middle of the fairway.

![Marie on Lodi's 7th fairway](/optimized/7-marie.webp)

*Marie on Lodi's 7th fairway*

Then comes the pièce de résistance: the 8th hole, a 305-yard par 4. Go for the drive and you'll likely greet the old-growth oaks, sending your ball into some rabbit territory. Play it safe and lay up short of the trees, only to have it roll down the slope anyway. The best I've ever managed here? A 19-degree 3-hybrid striped straight, then some imitation Lee Trevino 9-iron chip to get onto the green but not too much speed that it rolls off the backside. All while the beauty of the Wisconsin River stretches out below and a red-tailed hawk stares through you from above.

And when you've survived that, you're nearly home! No. 9, with the clubhouse staring you down, you remember this isn't Pinehurst—it's Lodi, and par carries its own kind of nobility that comes with a Miller Lite.

There are fancier courses, yes. Straighter fairways, faster greens, locker rooms with cold, fragrant towels. But none of them give you what Lodi National does: a front-row seat to the small, essential theater of people simply trying--sometimes failing, often laughing--to get the ball in the hole.

And that's why it's a nine-hole kingdom. Not because it's perfect, but because it's not.21:T1210,[Warnimont Golf Course in Milwaukee](https://mke.golf/warnimont/) is an 18-hole par-3 along Lake Michigan built on a former Army missile base. It winds through woods and wildflowers, and you'll often have doves perched on the edges of the greens, cooing for you to sink that very miss-able putt after your tee shot sat ten feet from the pin. Meanwhile, a shirtless man with a gold Rolex and a bag light with just a 4-hybrid, wedge, and blade putter, looking like [Pat Simmons if he'd chosen to haunt muni fairways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpBRiMrpdWU), gives you a squint. He doesn't need to speak; the glance alone makes you question why you ever called ahead for a tee time at a place where nobody does, while also letting you know you've stumbled into somewhere loose, free, and wonderful. 

It's not long at 2,717 yards, but the holes will make you miss, make you feel like you're playing golf rather than navigating a spreadsheet. A slice right on 7, and it disappears into the water, ready for some Thursday morning league player with a ball retriever to rescue it. Pull one left and you're tangled in tall prairie grasses and wandering turkeys. It doesn't matter if you're young or old, seasoned or brand new--anyone who's ever picked up a club will find themselves at home here and loving every moment of it.

[The Glen Golf Park in Madison](https://www.cityofmadison.com/parks/golf/courses/glen) doesn't feel city-bound at all, especially after its 2022 reopening. Even though it sits right in town, "The Glen" is quiet and tucked away, the kind of place where you can nearly forget you have neighbors. The closest are Forest Hill Cemetery, the [Village Bar](https://www.facebook.com/TheVillageBar/?_rdr), and the squirrels leaping through giant oak trees. Hole 5 feels like a quest. It's 443 yards to the pin--your drive carries over a stretch of prairie, then tumbles down a hill, threads a ravine framed by oaks, and climbs back up to an elevated green. It isn't a course you just play; it's one you explore. Every hole gives you something different. The rises and drops test your swing, and the tricky greens can turn a simple chip into a triple bogey. The four par-3s slip through native grasses, less like golf holes and more like puzzles. The payoff isn't just the shots you hit well; it's the walk itself. The smell of flowers in the air. Sunlight flashing off your ball like it belongs in the landscape. Late in the day, you might spot locals lining up putts, trading childhood stories from playing hide and seek in the cemetery next door or remembering how Glenway used to be.

These are places where golf actually works. Compact, untamed, forgiving when it needs to be, harsh when it doesn't.

Then there are the places that boast about being 18-hole championship courses. The kind taken straight from graph paper to bulldozer: efficient, maybe, but infinitely humorless. One straight par-4 after another, bunkers left and right, and throngs that can seem allergic to common courtesy. Everything gleams except the golf, and some of the people. Like the employee who must mention to one and all their "executive course, if you want something easier." Nope. I just want a beer, my clubs, and a walk through the woods. No rangefinder-waving guy blasting Kid Rock from a Bluetooth speaker. No polishing off a sixth double transfusion. Just me, the trees, and the quiet.

Sure, these places have perfect surfaces, perfect angles, every hole designed to look like it belongs on a magazine cover and just about as horizontal, too. Fun for an afternoon, sure, but when everything is nudged toward non-technical, perfectly manicured holes the game also flattens out. Golf isn't a photo-op where you strut around in PXG polos, careen your cart across the fairway, and throw off my wife's approach shot. It's meant to be a little remote, a little frustrating, and a lot grounding.

Warnimont and Glenway understand something simple: limits are essential. Some unstated courtesy and sedateness are essential. They force creativity, invite fun, and make a short round feel long, a simple hole feels alive and the whole thing a pleasurable experience. The wild and maybe even a little weird municipal. A thing you walk off feeling like you did something--that's the one that earns your love. Not the polished, soulless mega-course that fills social media feeds. As our friend Max James likes to put it, "These places aren't really courses at all, they're vibes."22:Te0e,Golf is about precision, discipline, focus. And yeah, it is. But the part that sticks with you long after the round is human. It's in laughter after a terrible swing. The quiet wins no one records on a phone or scorecard. The rituals that shape who we are long before we ever step onto a course.

That's why, when Grant Boone mentioned Jeongeun Lee5 is on YouTube, I had to check it out. What I found isn't just compelling. It's transformative.

Her [FIVE STAR channel](https://www.youtube.com/@이정은빠이브) has been on a tear lately with content from [Amundi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQt2KDElefA), [Standard Portland Classic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxAExOCRHWg), [CPKC Women's Open](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TlK5GaBejw), and the [FM Championship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suAXJt4H75k) but the videos also reveal something bigger than her skill with a golf club. Lee5 is a storyteller, a daughter, a cultural bridge. She's a woman in golf who plays with authority but moves through the game with playful ease and a lot of joy.

Take the finale of her first season, ["Tour Is My Life (Season 1 Finale) – Women are Power!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdKOM4l1SM8&t=1s) She spends a day on the course with her mother. It's not a lesson. It's a window into a life: teasing, care, warmth, playful banter. At one point, they argue over a missed putt, laugh, and then later share a bowl of kimchi jjigae. It's ordinary, it's tender, it's unforgettable. Beneath it all runs a current of love you can feel through the segment.

And it's the little things that hit hardest. Snacks pulled from her bag. Quick glances exchanged mid-round. A double bogey earns a laugh. A par brings quiet satisfaction. Golf and life aren't separate for her, they're braided together. Moments carry something familiar, human, and unpolished. They're refreshingly different from the usual LPGA highlights or standard player press coverage.

Yes, she's a world-class athlete. Her swing is sharp, her strategy deliberate, her poise undeniable. But she never frames her talent as untouchable. She's extraordinary, yes, but fully human: joyful, grounded, approachable. That duality is special.

Watching her reminds me that I, the Birdie Briefing, or you don't need a big plan to grow the exposure of the LPGA. Almost like a, "Hey, forget all that. Just start. Drive a car to a tournament course. Eat food with your mom. Sit on a stairwell waiting out a rain delay. Show young people at the course that they belong there. The gestures don't have to be polished. They just have to be real. They just have to be in the ether."

It hits me in a way like when my friends play without keeping score: Inclusive. Joyful. Silly. Markedly human. You don't need an actual goal or mission statement all the time. You need curiosity, care, and the courage to do something. That's it.

Her channel really is essential viewing. For fans, players, anyone who wants to see golf fully realized. To watch is to be invited into her world. Lee5 is quietly reshaping what it means to be a powerful woman in golf and she's asking all of us to walk alongside her. And if you don't, well…you're missing something worth seeing.

Marie and I have been following your game both on and off the course [(thanks to your Insta)](https://www.instagram.com/gigistoll_/), and we just have to say -- you crush it. The swagger, baseball Oakleys, long socks, and street-style threads made for golf -- your whole package just works. You’re showing that golf doesn’t have to be stiff, that it doesn’t have to wear pastel polos. You make it look easy.

And then there’s your music. [GG AKA Golf God](https://youtu.be/8v4wqc8X3hQ?si=upVZ6uXtvCR9sdzm). You’re writing lyrics and recording tracks like “Attention,” “Jealous,” and “Summer Love” while living as a touring pro. You do it without anyone needing to validate it. Few athletes -- or people, really -- could pull that off with this much truth.

We also read about how cutting your hair at the University of Arizona symbolizes personal freedom, and you’ve carried that truth forward ever since. You’ve turned your platform into one of encouragement, showing that life is too short to hide or conform. A life of truth that runs parallel to your golf journey. You show us that excellence doesn’t demand giving up what makes us unique. That it is possible to be multidimensional and brilliant all at once. 

And Gigi, what a joy to read you popped the question to your partner in the mountains of Switzerland. That is a beautiful, rare thing, and it deserves to be celebrated fully. Let it be a bright moment that adds even more light to your already vibrant life.

Keep swinging with style, speaking with honesty, and living with that fearless, unapologetic energy. We’ll be cheering from the gallery, excited to see where your next shot, song, or adventure takes you.

- Marie and George24:Te16,I've picked up my share of Titleist Pro V1s and Srixon Z-STARs. Balls lost and found like trophies from roughs and water hazards. I keep a handful in my bag, pulling them out when I'm convinced my slice has checked out for good. Call it superstition, but those balls start feeling like more than just urethane. But now, I have a new favorite: Champ. Or Champy, as Marie and I call him, the mascot of [The Dow Championship](https://dowchampionship.com/).

Why Champy? It's not sold in fun colors and doesn't offer a short game spin that my skills barely benefit from. Well, it's garnered something else from me: admiration.

June was a scorcher for players, right? Texas bakes them in the mid-90s with a heat index over 100 degrees. Then, windburned and weary, they haul themselves up north to Michigan, where it's a refreshing 75 to 80. And what else do they get when they roll into Midland Country Club? Not just a cozy golf course and a friendly crowd—but Champy, on its first birthday, dishing out cupcakes [next to a loon](https://www.milb.com/great-lakes/ballpark/lou-e). That's just part of what makes Champy and The Dow so admirable.

There's warmth and intimacy you don't find everywhere. It's a tight-knit Midwestern golf community where Dow employees and folks from neighboring towns show up shoulder-to-shoulder to cheer on the players and sing happy birthday to a giant, fluffy golf ball. It's a team event, too—the sort that can jolt a player's season back to life when the grind starts wearing thin. You can sense how much the players love it. You catch it in the laughter, feel it buzzing in the air, and see it shining through playful team names like Biggie Smalls, the Kilted Koalas, and Born to the Islands.

And all this aids the LPGA Tour in being more than a series of tournaments that showcases top-tier talent--it attracts new fans by mixing competition with that genuine community spirit. It is helping the game grow beyond the usual circles, bringing fresh eyes and enthusiasm to the sport. It makes the LPGA an even more powerful platform for promoting women's golf worldwide.

It's also where sponsorships make a real difference. Partnerships like Dow's don't just keep the tournament running; they fuel the visibility and opportunities female athletes need to thrive. In a world where women's sports still fight for equal airtime and funding, these sponsorships help bridge the gap, allowing players to chase their dreams and providing a venue for fans to watch.

And speaking of admiration, the tournament's ambassador, Suzann Pettersen, also embodies everything this event stands for. As a Solheim Cup captain, two-time major champion, and founder of [TeamVOXA(an athlete-first talent management group)](https://teamvoxa.com/), she's more than just a name. She's a role model who shows young girls what's possible when determination meets opportunity. Her leadership and vision help light the path for the next generation of female golfers, proving that success on and off the course goes hand in hand.

So yes, Champy might not spin like a Pro V1, but it's got heart and hustle and is the face of what's arguably one of the best weeks on the LPGA calendar. And it knows how to host the kind of party where the buzz never fades, strangers turn into friends, and the drama on the course has a rival in the fun and growth happening off it.

It’s the kind of experience that folds itself into you and reminds you why we watch, why we play, and why, no matter the ball in your bag, the soul of the game stays with you long after Champy blows out the candles.1e:["$","div",null,{"className":"bg-white min-h-screen","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-8","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-col lg:flex-row gap-8","children":[["$","main",null,{"className":"flex-1 max-w-4xl","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"mb-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-center gap-4","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 leading-tight tracking-tight","children":"Opinion"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex-1 h-px bg-gray-300"}]]}]}],["$","section",null,{"className":"pb-16","children":["$","$L1f",null,{"articles":[{"id":"lodi-national","slug":"lodi-national","title":"Lodi National: A Nine-Hole Kingdom","author":"George Hack","authorId":"george-hack","date":"2025-09-12","category":"Opinion","excerpt":"There are courses that look perfect on paper but feel off when you play them.
